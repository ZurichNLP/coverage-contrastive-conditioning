Women's volleyball is expected to defend the world cup ahead of time
On the 27th, the Chinese team was pulled back by their opponent after winning two straight games against the Dutch Women's volleyball, and ended up to a ninth straight win with 3:1 Rick Holland.
As the world cup is coming to an end, although the title is in sight, the Chinese women's volleyball can't be taken lightly in the face of Serbia.
In the first two games against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball performance was as strong as always, with 25:19,25:16 down two cities, until the third round, the team faced setbacks.
Dutch Women's volleyball increased the offensive in backward situation, and the Chinese team was hit, plus the girls offensive, the mistakes began to increase, and eventually pulled back to a city with 21:25
Langping also said in an interview: " in the third round, we sent about 8 points due to mistakes. PM
Of course, the power of Dutch Women's volleyball should not be underestimated. Even before the Chinese women's volleyball game, although i lost a game, everything is still in lang ping's control. "it is normal to win or lose with the strong team, and lose five games. It's normal, so we told the team to focus," lang ping said.
In the fourth round, the players positively adjusted their status, Zhang changning opened the offensive end. He scored 8 points in a single game to make a big win.
So far, there are only two rounds of the 11 rounds left. Although one hand has touched the champions trophy, it does sound a wake-up for Chinese women's volleyball in the match against the Netherlands: the more critical it is moments, the more you have to go out.
In another game on the 27th, Russia and the U.S. Women's volleyball filled 5 games, and the U.S. team failed to score all three points from their opponents, so the Chinese women's volleyball is only against Serbia with all three points in the game, you can defend the title in advance.
All things are moving towards the favorable situation in China's volleyball.
However, while Serbia's top six major players are missing, that doesn't mean they will easily send three points to the Chinese team.
In the current form of the scoreboard, Serbia have basically lost the medal, which means they can "Light" against China women's volleyball, let go to hit their opponents with full pressure to win. The State may instead be ups and downs.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team is not "slaughtered" Lamb, which was previously in a game against the Netherlands, and Serbia two teams finally turned the Netherlands 3:2 the full main lineup shows the depth of their lineup.
Before the third stage of the game, lang ping also said that both teams were not easy to deal with: " Osaka will be very difficult, we still have to prepare carefully as always. PM
Now that the defending horn has blown, the game is really into the " White heat
When it comes to strength, the Chinese women's volleyball is above their opponents. It's only the last crucial moment, and depends on whether women's volleyball girls can play their normal level and release themselves on the court.

The Republic is about to celebrate its th anniversary, the spotlight of various media, making many images we don't remember very often remember - it's them, bringing heat to our shining days, bring light source...
However, if a hero walks around, it also looks like you like me.
Yuan longping, dedicated to rice research, cultivating the world, has breeding more than a billion people from the risk of starvation. He usually like an old farmer who likes to walk around the field; rendong, the chief scientist who has worked hard to keep China's "eye of heaven" angry, a person, a lifetime, one thing in a pot, has only done in his life, eating cold steamed bun in the deep mountains of guizhou, nothing different from the old man in the stockade.; Zhou Yu-Chang, a red scientist, a late village boy, still looks like a naked son, learning in the west, holding a fluffy white hair, talking about learning to the heart, he likes to laugh; Qin Yi, the red film artist, after ninety years old, still bumping on the plateau for six or seven hours a day, and is happy to act as an unknown old maid in the legend of demons...
They seek benevolence, live simple, simple and persistence. As long as they are immersed in the careers and they do not understand themselves, they will easily live happily. They don't care about being rich and glory.
Just like jin yong's novels, Shaolin Temple, the floor-sweeping monastery, although he is shocked by martial arts, does not show no pride, no joy or sadness.
Every "sweeping monk", every pair of naked child, has a share of his home country that gives me.
The responsibility of the nation is not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of billions.
Once, the words of a female high school student, she was crazy by netizens, " when heroes pass by, someone must sit by and applaud...... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a person sitting by the roadside clapping. PM PM
In fact, being a hero and applause a hero is not contradictory.
People who applaud by the road are also passing heat and light, and they are also luminous.
Ordinary as you are like me, there are always some opportunities in life, there are moments, there are a kind of accumulation and also shaping the appearance of heroes.
Shanghai's outstanding judge zou bihua, who is responsible for judicial reform, but at the annual conference, let master of the communication room come to tell his story. He sent countless newspaper letters a year, " do the simple things well, it is not easy. " Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to this " sweeping monk " old collection.
This is the love between heroes, one hero applauding another hero.
The sweeping monks have shaolin monastery, Yuan longping has a vast rice experiment field, nan " sky eye... Qin yi has a stage, Zhou yu chang has a forum... can he be a hero, not alone you must rely on your own efforts, and have a good environment and positive motivational mechanism.
For example, " Chinese sky eye now it seems like a myth.
In the 90 s, China's science and technology community was still climbing hard, and novelist liu cixin has yet to write " three bodies
The greatest " eye " of the time was the single-Sided Radio Telescope in the Puerto Rico Valley of Puerto Rico - Arecibo, with a diameter of 350 meters, considered the most " insurmountable " world.
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was less than one tenth of others.
While Nandong, who enjoys world-class research conditions and salary in Japan, insists on returning to his country, bringing back an almost insane idea: building a new generation of radio "big telescope" in China and receive more messages from outer space. I am going to have a lot of
China is waiting to make a lot of money to play stars?
The motherland trusts in nan rendong, and the "sky eye" project has begun.
It took 12 years to choose the site, and the project was completed again 9
The 500-Meter-meter " eye " opened, and China has made no precedent to follow, " the world's unique big science project
Therefore, the "eye of heaven" is amazing, the south rendong are amazing, and the Republic Standing High-looking far away.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the citizens, the nan rendong have the chance to become the soul of the nation.
There are young talents, White-haired heroes passed by, and there are people clapping gently on the side of the road. Such a country is beautiful and harmonious.

Two houses of the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reforms next week, according to the European times reported on 26
French President Marlon recently claimed that France cannot " accept all " but at the same time strive to " properly
Macron is reportedly trying to find a compromise route on immigration matters to slow the shock of the upcoming debate.
Recently, in an interview during the general debate in New York, United States, macron expressed his hope for a real "Two-track" programme on immigration policies that strikes a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Mark Dragon said: " If France wants to properly accept (migrants), it cannot accept everyone
Macron lists four key points of immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection; promoting the integration of migrants more efficiently; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement illegally into France people who should not stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the national medical assistance system is the most discussed topic before.
Mark Dragon said he would like to be able to "Evaluate" the system, but instead of lifting it, but to limit it.
After Macron's remarks, far-right " National League " leader le peng tweeted that Mark Dragon's statement was " empty talk
Right-Wing Republican and Senate President rasher also said immigration policies should be discussed in a " moderate " but " Face-to reality indirectly criticizing Mark Dragon.
Leftist socialist lawmaker valau believes that France should " accept more and better " on immigration matters, and criticized macron for " fuck " on the subject.

Trudeau "man collapsed" can he succeed in re-election
This time tripped trudeau out of the "big pit" this time, trudeau dig up a little by trudeau himself.
Recently, Canadian media revealed several old photos of current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which trudeau dressed himself as black.
It was considered an apparent act of racism, prompting uproar in Canada.
Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public after it happened.
Canadians, however, aren't buying.
Trudeau was literally throwing a stone and smashed himself in the foot.
As political critics Riley and others point out, Trudeau and the federal liberals have been blaming opposition parties or dissidents in this regard since the rise of the United States. Lost "and repeatedly threatened" whoever makes this mistake should be fired immediately
In Short, this time trudeau tripped trudeau out of the "big pit" this time was dug up a little by trudeau himself.
Trudeau, son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was young and handsome, who had a whirlwind of "political idol" when he debut.
He was originally a " politician who took over as the federal liberal party head, fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 federal legislative election - the federal liberals over half of the federal lower house, gain valuable right to stand alone.
At the time, Trudeau put forward many deaf platforms, ideas such as " ethnicity and gender equality " Eco-friendly " economic revitalizing highlighting corruption and " bad wind
However, for 5 years in office, he has been in almost all of these areas, " high and down
Take the issue of " ethnicity and gender equality " aside this " Black face " incident, after he was " lip " in a series of Aboriginal peoples issues, making aboriginal groups and chiefs in addition on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada moved protest tents to the doorstep of the Capitol Hill.
In terms of fighting corruption, Trudeau was involved in the boiling "Rampanic incident" at the end of last year.
It was revealed that it was exposed to a major irregularities against the construction engineering company " LAN wanling " in his hometown, pressure on the department and officials responsible for investigation and prosecuting the latter to " be " to " be highly appreciated
Moreover, Trudeau is angry with the officials who disclose the corruption case - the previously mentioned earlier, was the attorney general of Canada at the first to disclose the corruption case.
Despite the doubts of the case itself, the suspect is difficult to clear.
Many observers point out that trudeau's 5-Year-old man collapse was mainly caused by his own " digging pit and that the biggest " pit " is " Self-eating " and " wider than the law these three.
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Red poll data shows that since 2015, respondents who supported trudeau slipped from over 60 % to more than 30 percent, while opponents have gone from opponents less than 30 % soar to more than 60
Even though other opposition parties and their party leaders are equally poor, even a significant percentage of voters who are willing to vote for the federal liberal vote, are now unhappy with the Federal Prime Minister, the ruling party leader.
As the new Canadian federal legislative election begins on October 21th, can trudeau repeat the drama that won 5 years ago?
The answer may be just one word: hard.
Whether it is from the level of corporate competition, consumer experience, or regional aviation integration and Jin-hei development integration, it has far-reaching and positive significance.

Witness a decade of "cloud rise" of digital China in yunqi town - xinhua net
If the 2009 local website forum is the origin, the 2019 Yunqi Convention held in hangzhou from 25 to 27 has passed a decade.
From a concept of "fog in the clouds to the practice of" Upper Cloud Large data, cloud computing became one of the core technologies that underpinned China's economic development, social management, and public services in 10
At zhengtai new energy photovoltaic battery workshop located in haining, Zhejiang, there are recently a new "colleague" with Ali yun artificial intelligence.
It is unstoppable for 24 hours, the recognition rate is more than twice as artificial, and the accuracy of quality inspection is stable at more than 95
According to the head of the company, this " quality examiner " with cameras " has concentrated on learning more than 40 flaws. with the cloud computing power behind it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language. Flawed battery pieces are sorted.
This business is just a epitome of today's cloud computing boost manufacturing transformation.
The Ministry of industry and informatics issued the guide to promote cloud implementation (2018-2020) in 2018, which aims to achieve a significant increase in cloud awareness and motivation in business, with the upper cloud ratio and depth of application. Elevated.
Today, data-centered cloud computing has opened the way for the digital economy as key elements of the data, said Wang Jian, said.
Meanwhile, the cloud computing industry in China has been expanding in 10 years.
China's cloud computing development white paper (2019) released in July this year, according to the overall market size of cloud computing was 96280 Billion Yuan, an increase of 39.2 % compared to 2017
In addition to becoming the key technology supporting industrial transformation, digital economy development, the invisible "Cloud" has unwittingly changed urban management and social life.
The "Urban Brain" that unveiled for the third consecutive year at the yunqi convention is still drawing attention.
Ariyun said that the urban brain has now moved from traffic management tools to urban management hub, and the associated collaborative application has been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through Camera Perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain makes it possible to achieve new urban management services such as " parking before pay " Real-time perception " tour design
In the area of administrative services, using " one cloud " docking " one thing to promote " on hand office " in hand cloud computing brings convenience to both ends of the supply of government services.
At Present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through the administration.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 5700 million permanent residents and more than 1500 million French units in the province, combining 19080 million data from 3066 categories.
On average monthly calls between Zhejiang Provincial Government departments, the data has been 12000 million times, and every more call flow of data on 'Cloud' may mean that the masses run less.
Be careful with plastic tea bag to make tea!
A recent study in Canada found that a bag of plastic tea bags could release billions, or even billions of plastic microplastic microplastic, significantly higher than one's estimated throughout the year, according to a report. Quantity, but so far there is no evidence that intake of plastic particles poses a threat to humanity.
Researchers at maggil university in Canada reportedly found that immersing plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiled hot water (95 degrees Celsius), the tea bag will release about 11600 million plastic particles and 3100 millions of smaller nani plastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics estimated by a person throughout the year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50 million plastic particles each year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
The study was reportedly published in the journal of environmental science and technology, where researchers tested 4 different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and cafe, opening the tea bags and dip it into almost boiling 5 minutes in the water, then analyzed with electron microscope and spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag releases more than 11600 million plastic particles, " several stages higher than the plastic load of other foods
Most Tea Bags are made of natural fiber, but many brands made of natural fiber still use plastic to seal.
Some branded tea bags are no longer paper and instead of plastic, which researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic that researchers define the size between 100 nanometers and 5 Millimetres and are mainly produced by decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers found microplastics in air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, which can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first found plastic particles in human poop samples from several countries in different regions of the globe in October 2018
In order to test the potential toxicity of the tea bags release of plastic particles, the Canadian research team put fleas into contaminated water and found that microplastics affect the behavior of these fleas and cause them to develop deformations.
According to the world health organization (who), there is no evidence that intake of plastic particles poses a threat to humanity.
However, who noted that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact it has on humans.
Researchers speculate that these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles, possibly because these plastic tea bags are in contact with boiling water, even if "Edible Grade" plastic heated to 40 degrees Celsius, they may break down toxic substances.
Guterres said climate emergencies are the biggest threat to the survival of small island states.
There, a natural disaster will erode development gains for a generation.
The disasters of Barbuda, Dominican and the Bahamas that have been hit by hurricanes since this year.
About a quarter of people in small island developing states live at an altitude of 5 meters or less.

By the middle of the century, many regions could happen every year some extreme sea-level rise that would have taken place once in a century.
The report warns that some island countries could well become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification caused huge losses.
In the last 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has risen tenfold in the last 40 years.
Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to shrinking resources, including maintaining fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small Island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, leaving them affected by fluctuations in prices.
Some countries are also working to address the security impact of illegal trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: " by solving a problem in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing states to achieve the sustainable development agenda 2030 will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that can be drawn from around the world. PM
He stressed that small island developing states are special examples of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.

" over-age migrant workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where to find young workers now?
There is no way I don't want to use so many ' old people ' on site. PM
Recently, zou kui, who has been a construction contractor in the construction industry for a long time, said that there are many overage migrant workers (above retirement age) on site.
Recently, the university where the writer is located has carried out rain pollution diversion project, and there have been a lot of migrant workers on campus. If you look carefully, you will find that there are a lot of over-aged farmers.
Overage migrant workers are not " idle but because " cannot be leisure they have to do so " helpless and hardship - whether it is saving money to solve their elderly and medical problems, or helping their children. These elderly people who should have " leisure " continue to work hard.
Overage migrant workers are not as easy as we thought.
Raise Children, support the elderly, help children build buildings, buy cars, help kids build a family, raise their grandchildren, raise their grandchildren, when these migrant workers accomplish their " life task money bags have been emptied and even a lot of debt most lack of wealth accumulation.

Chemezov said Russia will not export such a system for the next five years because " supply its own troops first before export production will be carried out
This approach is fully consistent with international practice.
Major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, general Yuri Grikhoff, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Space Ministry, said the development of the system is near completion.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Antay" Sky Defense Kangzion.
This is the new generation of air defense systems that employs working principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamics goals.
The S-500 main function is to intercept mid-range ballistic missiles, capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3500 ki
In addition, according to certain information, the s-500 could also destroy high-Sonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, high-speed missiles more than 5 times the sonic missiles, and even located in near space.
This weapon can also be integrated with other air defense systems into integrated networks, especially s-400 systems, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergey Chemezov expressed special concern for s-400
He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the arctic.
S-400 air defense system enters Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to September 15, the new ground Island Arctic Air Defense Corps has been completed to modify the s-400 Anti-aircraft missile system.
It's not Russian militarization in the arctic.
Russia's defense ministry says it is entirely a process within the transition plan for more advanced defense tools to the north.
" with the transition to the new s-400 Air Defense System, the arctic's controllable airspace has significantly increased, Russia fleet news service. PM
Very importantly, according to military assessment, the system has been used successfully in both north and arctic areas.
Air Defense force officers trained on the new system and are ready to enter combat duty.
Previously equipped with s-300 long-range air defense systems, some of them are still maintained.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying various aerial targets, whether they are targets at high-High-speed flight at the outer altitude or "leakage" near protected facilities.
The S-400 Triumph System, developed by "Gold Diamond-Antay" Sky Defense Kangcaine, designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, ultrasonic targets and other aerial attacks, according to open sources. Weapons.
The Weapon could attack aerodynamics targets within a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic target of 4.8 kilometers per second.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defense forces in the far north to ensure safe airspace on the northern sea.
Not long ago, the first 12 "Tor-m2dt" Anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen air defense systems in the arctic.
The Russian defense ministry at that time said that the arctic "Thor" troops will be expanded to full brigade-level establishment in the future.
Along with the newly deployed s-400 remote systems deployed to new ground island and Cora Peninsula and the "pantsir - sa" short range systems deployed in the far north, these advanced air defense weapons are strong defense of Russia polar sky of s.
Enemy Planes, helicopters and drone missiles will be hard to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complicated and long process of opening their own stores.
Russia's multi company, as a Russian store operator, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Russia's largest trading platforms such as tmall, Kyoto (JD), 1688, 1688, pinduoduo, hand q (Shouq), Multi-Function Instant messaging software wechat (wechat) online store and own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian merchandise retail chain.
The Russian export center will work with Russia to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards, and screen virtual shelves on-shelves.
The store is scheduled to open before the end of the year with at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
Russian export center data shows that China's e-Commerce platform has reached 1000 billion visits per month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have seen steady growth since 2014, surpassed $ 1000 billion in 2018
Currently, alibaba group will also open pilot shops to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the global import strategy.
According to Alexi Kozevnikov, the new store will display goods for businesses selling at least Rs 500 billion or more.
Honestly, my expectation is higher, and 500 billion rubles are not worth nothing.
As we all know, Chinese consumers are pretty positive about Russian goods, treating our goods as high quality and environmentally friendly products."
Kozhev Nikov said the competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is intense and intensifying.
" our goal is ambitious, launching 500 businesses through this store in three years. PM
At the same time, the platform will also launch products from Russian far east businesses.
Vyacheslav Cheglov Cheglov, professor of the basic teaching and research department of trade policy at prehanov, Russia: " it is a political project representing the image of both sides, because the Russian export center is state-owned rather than private institutions."
" I didn't see a large number of highly competitive Russian goods on the market. PM
He believes the project will probably not actually be implemented, but will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, said during the eastern economic forum, product information of more than 170 Russian enterprises has been among the largest international, according to Russia news agency. Released on the wholesale online platform Alibaba.com, available in China and in other countries.

The Repurchase of listed companies exceeded 100000 billion yuan in the year - xinhua net
In order to stabilize the company's share price and safeguard the image of the company, listed companies have started to repurchase shares frequently in the last two years. Through Directional Repurchases, pooled bidding trading, hoping to pass the information that the company's value is underrated to the market, faith.
Oriental Wealth Choice data shows that the funds for repurchase of shares of listed companies in 2017 was 7900 billion Yuan, surged to 51000 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total repurchase of a-shares listed companies have been implemented. The amount has exceeded 100000 billion Yuan, setting a-time high in repurchases of a shares, far higher than previous years.
Judging from the purpose of repurchase, the company's Repurchase Shares seems the same as big shareholders, but there are a lot different in terms of implementation main body, source of funds, the purpose of repurchase, equity and equity and so on.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mikerong Information Consulting Ltd, said in an interview with a reporter of the securities daily, the "opinion on supporting listed companies repurchase of shares" published in November 2018, targeted at the scope of shares. The problems of the current system such as narrow, complicated decision-making procedures and poor inventory system have been repaired. The phenomenon of Repurchase Shares has increased sharply since the previous policy to encourage listed companies to buy shares.
In January this year, the exchange and deep exchange officially issued the implementation rules for repurchase of listed companies. These policies have broaden the sources of funds for listed companies, properly simplify the implementation procedures, guide improved governance arrangements and encourage various listed companies to implement equity incentive or employee ownership plan.
After the opinion was released, listed companies conduct shares Repurchase Operations, with more suitable conditions, the repurchase process is easier and more motivated for shares.
Repurchasing shares at a relatively low position also helps listed companies improve the efficiency of use of funds, thus increasing the profitability per share, increase net asset return, and relieve the pressure on corporate profit index.
Compared to the increase of large shareholders, the significance of Repurchase Shares of listed companies is more important, and it also embodying their willingness to manage their active market value management and abundant
Xu Yang believes that the underrated share price is the main factor in the repurchase of listed companies, and the shares of the company no longer reflect the future development prospects of the company, so such companies deserve the attention of investors, but they cannot blindly invest, we need to pay attention to pay attention to such listed financial report and specific business situation.
Listed companies with Mass Repurchase Behavior, at least show the company's confidence and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for repurchase of listed companies has gradually heated, and it also regularized repurchase behavior. Data shows that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented shares this year, and that the leading companies in various industries become the main force of the Repurchase Market.
China peace recently disclosed the Repurchase Progress, saying that the company has accumulated 57590 million shares of shares through centralized bidding trading, accounting for 0.315 % of the company's total capital, and the total funds paid is 5000 billion Yuan (excluding transaction costs), Repurchase Shares will be fully used for employee ownership plans, including but not limited to long-term service plans already considered by the company's shareholders meeting.
Ili shares have paid $ 5792 billion for stock repurchase and has recently adjusted the use of repurchased shares, with the original plan " Repurchase Shares will be used as a source of stock for later implementation of stock incentive " to " Repurchased 183 billion shares, of which 152 million are used to implement equity incentives, and the remaining 30490 million shares will be used to reduce registered capital
Ili shares said that some of the repurchased shares will help further raise the level of return per share and increase the return of the company's shareholders.
Tcl Group Issued A Repurchase Progress announcement on September 25, showing that tcl group has accumulated repurchased 3.59 % of shares in the company at a total cost of 1650 billion yuan.
The Tcl Group's board office told securities daily reporters that repurchase shares will be used for employee ownership plans, equity incentive or convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
Tcl group adhere to established business strategies, constantly improve competitiveness and continue to develop healthily.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the interests of investors, combining the performance of the company's secondary market in recent year, and taking into account the company's operating situation and financial situation, the company plans to use its own funding and other ways to return buying shares in the company.
Former Shanghai open source fund chief economist yang delong said that the operation of repurchasing shares of listed companies can reduce the number of shares in the market and increase the earnings per share of listed companies is an important benefit to the secondary market; in addition, listed companies are willing to take the initiative to pull out real gold and silver and buy back stocks from the stock market, which greatly boost market confidence.
The Repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially chips, and it is a very good way to boost investor s' confidence through stock buybacks.

Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions carried out by the ministry of finance has basically completed.
Central business rotation has taken on a certain scale.
At the local level, the work of enterprise's pre-shift has been carried out one after another.

The State-owned investment transfer enriching social security fund - starting from the starting point of " enriching social security fund money bag the destination is to provide strong support for pension security.
However, the writer believes that this is not a simple " physical shift " of equity, but the " Mathematical addition
On September 20, the ministry of finance, ministry of human and social affairs, the state affairs commission, the administration of taxation and the sfc jointly issued the circular on the full push of some state-owned capital to enrich the work of the social security fund. The Fund schedule, the central and local transfer of parts of State-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, was fully rolled in 2019

On September 25, the ministry of finance transferred 10 % of the shares of icbc and agricultural bank to the social security fund, with a total value of over 115000 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, the social security foundation and other undertakings as financial investors, enjoy the right to gain, disposition and the right to be informed of State-owned shares.
Icbc and agriculture bank said in the announcement that this change in equity will not lead to changes in its holding shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the writer believes that similar state-owned equity transfer is not a simple change to ownership, but a "addition operation" that can inspire a series of effects.
The first step of the "added result" of the transfer of some state capitals to social security, naturally can embody the national ownership of State-owned enterprises and the development results shared by all.
After years of reform and development, State-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in our economy, with strong profitability and stable.
Among them, the leading companies are constantly realizing the best and bigger and stronger.
On July 10, the State Council's standing meeting decided that this year, it will launch the state-owned capital to enrich the work of the social security fund.
The Ministry of finance immediately said, in collaboration with the relevant departments, according to the deployment of the state council general meeting, it will make a comprehensive push to some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflect the intergenerational equity of the basic pension system and the development outcome of State-owned enterprises
The second step of "added results" is to enhance the sustainability of our country's social security fund and further strengthen the foundation of old-Age Social Security System.
As the population aging, our country's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national capital, as the subject of the transfer, have the ability to continue profitability and dividends effectively replenish the social security fund, but also provide the source of the social security fund.
Estimates Show that every 3.8 percent of State-owned capital can support a reduction in the deposit ratio of basic pension insurance for enterprises by 1 percent.
The third step of the "added result" is adding stabilizer to capital markets.
The way of this transfer to receive benefits is " dividends, and operate as auxiliary
The Social Security Fund, as financial investors in state-owned capital, really focuses on dividends.
However, the social security fund, as value investors in the capital market, has strong capital operational capacity.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, social security fund participation in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, which will help improve the business level of business and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the social security fund, as an investment vane, the increase in its stake, helps to further strengthen its influence in the market and play a "Stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it also helps to fully utilize the "Value Discovery" function of agency investors, and guide investors to invest rational and value investment.
