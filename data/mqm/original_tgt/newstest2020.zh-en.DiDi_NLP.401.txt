The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers.
Comprehensive foreign media reports, the IAEA report pointed out that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility "are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
Since US President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May last year and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear agreement with major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use the first generation IR-1 centrifuge to extract uranium.
The other signatories to the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to Kyodo News, on the afternoon of the 25th local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Mogi Minchong held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, USA, where he visited, confirming that he would advance the peace treaty including the four northern islands (Japan-Russia disputed islands, Japan called the "four northern islands", Russia called the "Southern Thousand Islands") The territorial issue has been negotiated to develop relations between the two countries in a wide range of political and economic fields. The two sides also reached agreement on coordinating Mogi's visit to Russia as soon as possible.
This is the first consultation with Russia as the person in charge of the negotiation of the conclusion of a peace treaty after Mogi took office as foreign minister.
Mogi told the Russian side, "Including the promotion of common economic activities (in the four northern islands), I hope to carry out effective consultations."
According to the Japanese government, the talks did not discuss the territorial issue in detail.
At the Japan-Russia summit meeting in December 2018, the foreign ministers of the two countries confirmed the policy of accelerating negotiations as the person in charge.
At this meeting, the foreign ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in consultations on common economic activities in the fields of tourism and waste disposal.
Mogi expressed his expectation for the pilot tourism business scheduled to be implemented in October: "I hope it will be successfully implemented and lead to the next step."

The women's volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th, in the game against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team was pulled back to the city by their opponents in a two-game winning streak, and finally beat the Netherlands 3-1 to usher in a nine-game winning streak.
The schedule of the World Cup is nearing completion. Although the defending is on the horizon, in the face of the Serbian team, the Chinese women's volleyball team can not be taken lightly.
In the first two innings of the game with the Netherlands, the performance of the Chinese women's volleyball team was as strong as ever. They went to the two cities at 25:19 and 25:16 respectively. Until the third game, the team encountered setbacks.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened the offensiveness of the serve in a backward situation. The Chinese team was hit by a pass. Coupled with the girls' eagerness to attack, mistakes also began to increase. Finally, they were pulled back to the city by their opponents at 21:25.
After the game, Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview: "In the third game, we sent about 8 points because of mistakes."
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated. The Chinese women's volleyball team also made difficult preparations before the game. Although one game was lost, everything was still under the control of Lang Ping. "It's normal to win or lose with the strong team, so we told the players to focus", Lang Ping said.
In the fourth game, the players actively adjusted their status. Zhang Changning had full firepower on the offensive end and scored 8 points in a single game, making great contributions to the team's victory.
So far, there are only two rounds left in the 11-round confrontation. Although the Chinese women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, it did sound the alarm for the Chinese women's volleyball team against the Dutch team: the more critical moment, the more you have to go all out.
In another game on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball teams played 5 innings. The US team failed to take all three points from their opponents. As a result, as long as the Chinese women's volleyball team took all three points against Serbia, they can be defended one round in advance.
All kinds of situations are developing in favor of the Chinese women's volleyball team.
However, although the Serbian team's six main players are all missing, this does not mean that they will easily give three points to the Chinese team.
Judging from the form of the current standings, the Serbian team has basically missed the medal, which means that they can "light up" in the game against the Chinese women's volleyball team, put down the burden to fully impact the opponent, and the Chinese team is under pressure to win the championship. Instead, there may be ups and downs.
In addition, the substitute Serbia team is not a lamb of "slaughtering". In the previous battle with the Dutch team, the two sides fought 5 games. The Serbian second team finally reversed the Dutch main lineup 3:2, which shows the thickness of its lineup.
Before the start of the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that the Dutch and Serbian teams are not easy to deal with: "The game in Osaka will be very difficult. We still have to prepare as always."
Now the defending horn has been blown, and the game has really entered the "white heat stage."
On the strength of the lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team is above their opponents, but it is only the last moment. It depends on whether the women's volleyball girls can play their normal level and release themselves on the field.

On September 24, the "One Boat Ticket Takes Me to See" Caring for the Disabled event was held in Changsha Orange Island. More than 100 people with disabilities from Changsha were invited to board the Orange Island Star Cruise to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities participating in this event boarded the cruise for the first time.
56-year-old Zhao Zhengang is a handicapped person. Due to inconvenient movement of his feet, he rarely goes out.
He said: "I took a cruise for the first time today, admiring the magnificence of the Xiangjiang River up close, and feeling the pulse of Changsha's development. I am very excited and unforgettable."
Volunteers from Changsha Fukang Social Work Service Center and Blue Sky Rescue Team provided meticulous services for people with disabilities.

The Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary. The spotlights of various media are shining brightly, so that many images that we don't usually remember are shining-it is them, for those shining days of us, inextricably bring heat and light source...
However, if the hero walks around, it seems ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping, devoted to rice research, bred good seeds all over the world, so that more than one billion people no longer have the fear of hunger and great achievements, this man is usually like an old farmer who likes to walk in the field; Nan Rendong, the chief scientist who is so angry with China, one person, one life, one pot, one life, only one thing in the village, I am happy to talk about the old cat in the deep mountains of Guizhou
They, benevolent and benevolent, live simple, simple and persistent. As long as they are immersed in the cause that outsiders can't understand and they are arrogant, they will easily be happy, and they don't care about the fame and fortune.
Just like in Jin Yong's novels, the sweeping monk in the Shaolin Temple Tibetan scripture pavilion, despite his thrilling martial arts, is not dazzling, and has no joy or sorrow.
Every "sweeping monk", every pair of red-hearted hearts, has a home country for me.
The home country is not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also on the palms of hundreds of millions of people.
Once, a female middle school student was madly turned by netizens, "When a hero passes by, there must always be someone sitting on the roadside applauding... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a person sitting on the roadside applauding."
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
Those who applaud by the roadside are also transferring heat and light, and they are also luminous bodies.
Ordinary is like you, like me, there are always some opportunities in life, there are moments, there is a kind of accumulation, and it is also shaping the appearance of a hero.
Shanghai Excellent Judge Zou Bihua, who shoulders the heavy responsibility of judicial reform, has sent the teacher of the communication room to tell his story at the annual meeting. He has sent and received countless newspaper letters a year, and he has never made mistakes. "Doing simple things is not easy". Zou Bihua led the judges to send the applause to the old "sweeping monk" send and receive.
This is a sympathy between heroes, and one hero is applauding another hero.
The sweeping monk has the Shaolin Temple Tibetan scripture pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experiment field, Nanrendong has the "eye of heaven", Qin Yi has the stage, and Zhou Ruchang has the forum... Whether you can be a hero depends not only on your own efforts, but also on a good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "Chinese Sky Eye" now appears to be a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese scientific and technological community was still climbing hard, and the novelist Liu Cixin had not yet written "Three Body."
At that time, the most powerful "eye" was the single-sided caliber radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico Island in the United States-Arecibo, with a diameter of 350 meters, which is considered to be the most "insurmountable" in the world.
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was less than one-tenth the diameter.
Nan Rendong, who enjoys world-class scientific research conditions and salary in Japan, insists on returning to China and brings back an almost crazy idea: building a new generation of radio "big telescope" in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China is a waste of life, is it a huge investment to play the stars?
The motherland trusted Nan Rendong, and the "Sky Eye" project kicked off.
It took 12 years to select the site, and another 9 years after the project was completed.
With the opening of the "Sky Eye" with a caliber of 500 meters, China has made a "big scientific project unique in the world" without precedent.
Therefore, the "Sky Eye" is amazing, the Nanrendong are amazing, and the republic with a large capacity and a long way to stand is amazing.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong had the opportunity to become the soul of the country and the courage of the people.
There are young talents and white-haired heroes walking by, and there are people applauding gently on the roadside. Such a country is very beautiful and harmonious.
Waste sorting education first entered Jilin kindergarten environmental protection concept started from the doll
On the 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province conducted a garbage sorting education class to teach young children to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other types of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage sorting has entered the local early childhood education classroom.
A few days ago, nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the "Jilin Province Work Plan for Promoting the Classification and Treatment of Municipal Domestic Waste."
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot of the compulsory classification of domestic waste in Changchun City, the province decided to carry out domestic waste sorting in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, we will achieve the effect of using young children to drive the family and kindergarten to drive the society, and advocate the concept of environmental protection.
Liu Lijuan, executive director of Hi Faner International Kindergarten, who held the event, said.
On the same day, the director read out the environmental protection proposal, hoping that garbage sorting will start with the children.
After the children performed the "Low Carbon Babe" dance, they started a small game of garbage sorting in groups.
The instructor also issued "recyclable" and "other garbage" labels, suggesting that the children stick the labels to the trash can and record small videos after returning home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has always advocated the concept of low-carbon, green and environmental protection, and regularly opened environmental protection lectures.
Sortable trash cans are also set up at the garbage dumps in the park, and the dumping categories are marked on them.

According to preliminary statistics, the amount of urban domestic waste generated in Jilin Province in 2018 was about 5.4652 million tons, all of which went to domestic waste disposal sites for treatment.
Among them, 3.293 million tons of sanitary landfill, 2.0923 million tons of incineration, and a comprehensive utilization process of 80,100 tons.
After years of hard work, all cities and counties in the province have the ability to harmlessly dispose of domestic waste.
The "Jilin Province Work Plan for Promoting the Classification and Treatment of Municipal Domestic Waste" that has been issued clearly requires in-depth activities such as garbage sorting into campuses, textbooks, and classrooms, and through the creation of garbage sorting songs, songs, comics, micro-videos, etc. To strengthen the interaction between students and parents, to achieve the effect of "educating a child, affecting a family, driving a community, and cultivating new generations."
According to data released by Mazda on September 27, global sales in August were 117,015.
Due to the impact of insufficient new car launches and reduced price cuts, sales in China fell by 21%.
Domestic sales in Japan decreased by 6%, and the demand for the last bus before the consumption tax increase in October was limited.
In August, Mazda sold 17,729 vehicles in China.

Sales of China's main SUV "CX-4" decreased by 14%.
A long time has passed since the launch of "CX-4" in 2016, and the effect of new cars has declined.
Reducing price cuts due to a long-term strategy to increase brand value is also reported to have a great impact on sales.
Mazda's sales in the United States increased by 7% year-on-year to 27,482 units, an increase of 14 months.
In August, the seller's business day was one day longer than the previous year, and the addition of "strengthening promotion and other promotional activities" (Mazda) led to an increase in sales of SUVs such as "CX-5."
Domestic sales in Japan fell by 6% to 14,422 units.
The company said that the emergency panic buying before the tax increase "has not reached the level of the previous (2014)."
Sales of small cars such as "Demio" decreased.
Chirac's death as a political legacy
On the 26th local time, former French President Chirac died suddenly at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is undergoing major changes that have not been seen in a century, the French politician's many political legacies left in power that year are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac served as French President for 12 years in a very personal way.
He not only inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Charles de Gaullism, but also firmly supported European integration, and was a representative of the pursuit of the "European Dream."
At the same time, he also vigorously advocates world multipolarization and multilateralism and is a politician with a strategic vision.
For this reason, the French media commented that he was "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage."
One of Chirac's relishing political decisions is to oppose the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France and Germany withstood the pressure of the United States and walked at the forefront of the anti-war.
A year after the outbreak of war, he predicted that the Iraq war would lead to increased terrorist activities and make the world more dangerous.
Later facts proved that Chirac's warning was very correct.
At a time when European integration is in doubt and American unilateralism is becoming more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightening significance.
Chirac is also a French politician who makes Chinese people feel familiar and kind.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of Sino-French relations. After being elected French President for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with a politician's strategic vision.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During Chirac's administration, the bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly, and the two countries have made breakthrough progress in cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transportation and other fields.
The Sino-French Cultural Year initiated by Chirac created a brand new cultural exchange model in the history of China and France.
Chirac's love for Chinese culture throughout his life was particularly impressive.
According to Chinese diplomats who know him, Chirac can recite some poems by Li Bai and Du Fu, and can even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
"Not seeing the pyramids is not really going to Egypt, not seeing the Qin Terracotta Warriors is not really going to China"-this golden sentence comes from Chirac.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters, Chirac said: "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, ecological problems arising from China's economic growth, and China's international political status.
But I myself have full confidence in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it establish the concept and values of achieving harmonious development and assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. "
I also think that China's renaissance will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich world culture.
The Sri Lankans have gone, but Chirac's political legacy and revelation to the world will survive forever.

Some members of the Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council issued a joint statement on the 27th, expressing strong opposition to the passage of the "2019 Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act" by the Foreign Committees of the US Senate and the House of Representatives.
The statement, signed by 40 members of the formed faction, stated that the rights currently enjoyed by Hong Kong are granted by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs zone, and signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in different fields such as economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, and sports in the name of "Hong Kong, China."
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
All along, Hong Kong has strictly abided by international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with different countries and regions, and participated in cooperation in many related fields. The achievements are remarkable and obvious to all.
The statement said that the passage of relevant bills by the Foreign Committees of the US House of Representatives and the House of Representatives was not necessary, but only in response to the call of its agents in Hong Kong as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and obtaining political bargaining for its agents in Hong Kong.
Members of the formed faction deeply regret the move by the American Association and strongly oppose it.
The statement pointed out that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and clean society make it a good location for American businessmen to do business.
If the United States passes this bill, in addition to combating the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, it will also worsen Sino-US relations, without any benefits, and harm others.
The statement stated that Hong Kong will, as always, unwaveringly implement the "one country, two systems" policy, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law, and earnestly fulfill its obligations.
Whether in the past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make due contributions to the international community and international business.
According to the "European Times" report on the 26th, the two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Macron recently claimed that France can not "accept everyone", but at the same time it must strive to "properly accept."
According to reports, Macron tried to find a compromise route in immigration matters to slow the impact of the upcoming debate.
Recently, Macron said in an interview during the general debate of the UN General Assembly in New York, USA, that he hopes to have a real "two-pronged" plan on immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Macron said: "If France wants to accept (immigration) properly, it can not accept everyone."
Macron cited four key points of immigration policy: granting asylum qualifications to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; promoting the integration of immigrants more efficiently; receiving and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; and resettling people who enter France illegally and are not suitable for stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "National Medical Assistance" (AME) system has been the subject of most discussion before.
Macron said he hopes to "evaluate" the system, but does not cancel it, but restricts it.
After Macron's remarks, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right "National League", tweeted that Macron's position was "empty talk."
Rascher, a member of the right-wing Republican faction and the speaker of the Senate, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderate" but "face to reality" way, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Varau, a member of the Left Socialist Party, believes that on the issue of immigration, France should "accept more and better" and criticize Macron for "manipulating" the issue.
The report pointed out that the new version of the "Asylum and Immigration Law" has been promulgated for one year. It has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time it has failed to appease the right opposition party.
In the next 2022 general election, the topic of immigration policy will once again become the focus of far-right attacks. Macron needs to make a difference on this issue, but at the same time it will also risk angering the left-wing people within the ruling party.
According to reports, the lower house of the French National Assembly will debate immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will debate from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are ushering in a "repurchase tide", and many listed companies have come up with "real money" to repurchase company stocks.
According to the statistics of financial data service provider Oriental Fortune, as of the 27th, the total amount of repurchase implementation of A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB, the same below), far exceeding the data of the same period in previous years, setting a record high in A-share repurchase funds.
In this regard, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mai Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said that the overall valuation of the A-share market this year is low, and the repurchase of shares at a relatively low price is conducive to listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds. It also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and sufficient cash flow conditions, which will help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system has also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchases.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued implementation rules for listed companies to repurchase shares, which provided detailed rules and guidelines for listed companies to repurchase shares.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented a shareholding repurchase plan are mainly concentrated in the infrastructure industry, real estate industry, information technology industry, and electronic equipment manufacturing.
In addition, judging from the amount of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, Yili shares ranked first, with a repurchase amount of more than 5 billion yuan.
What impact will the repurchase of stocks by listed companies have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance and Finance of Renmin University of China, said in an interview with China News Service that the repurchase on the one hand shows that listed companies have strong economic strength and good financial status, and have the ability to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, for the market, and for investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, while the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have a high quality.
For the capital market, this is the most basic element.
The repurchase of stocks by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and has a supporting effect on the stock prices of listed companies.
According to estimates by the Oriental Securities Research Report, based on the estimated number of stock repurchases set by A-share listed companies as a whole since the beginning of this year, and the average transaction price of stocks that have been repurchased, the incremental capital brought by the repurchase of stocks to the A-share market this year is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
It took nearly two months for the restoration of the large mural "Tianhou Sacred Map" of Tianjin Tianhou Palace, a national key cultural protection unit, to be completed on the 26th and will be reopened to the public during the National Day this year.
"Tianhou Sacred Map" is a large-scale traditional mural that comprehensively reflects the life of Mazu.
Approved by relevant state departments, it was drawn by Cai Changkui, former director of Tianjin Folklore Museum (Tianhou Palace) from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this mural is painted on the south and north palace walls of the main hall of Tianhou Palace. It is 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high. It is divided into upper and lower parts. It uses more than 30 stories such as the birth of the queen, the crossing of the sea, and the ascension of the feather. 358 characters reproduce the life story of Mazu.
Cai Changkui said that in recent years, Tianjin has been rainy in summer and dry in winter. This "one wet and one dry" has caused the murals to crack, and the cracked parts account for 60% of the entire mural area.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of Mazu's deeds, the Management Committee of Ancient Culture Street and Tianhou Palace of Nankai District of Tianjin City launched the restoration project of the murals of the Tianhou Palace Hall and the hall.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui and invited four famous Chinese painters to participate together.
The restoration work is based on the principle of "repairing old as old", and at the same time, the original murals have been partially adjusted to supplement and repair the areas where the murals were not perfect.
During the restoration, we have also made innovations and attempts in colors, materials, pens and inks.
After the restoration, the style, spirituality, spirit and artistic style of the original murals were maintained.
The Tianhou Palace was built in 1326, formerly known as the Tianfei Palace, commonly known as the Niangniang Palace. It has been rebuilt many times and is the oldest building complex in the urban area of Tianjin. It is also one of the earliest surviving Mazu temples in China.
On September 25, the commissioning ceremony of Beijing Daxing International Airport was grandly held.
The shape of the terminal building of Beijing Daxing International Airport means "Phoenix Spreading its Wings" and is hailed as the first of the "Seven Wonders of the New World."
At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is already overloaded. Last year, it carried 100 million + passengers and became the second airport in the world to have an annual passenger throughput of more than 100 million passengers after Atlanta Airport in the United States.
It is expected that by 2022, the passenger throughput of Beijing Daxing International Airport will reach 45 million passengers, accounting for 20% of international flights; by 2025, the passenger throughput will reach 72 million passengers, and the proportion of international flights is expected to reach 30%.
As a "new country gate", how cool is it?
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City, Hebei Province, with a straight-line distance of 46 kilometers from Tiananmen Square. It is currently the largest new airport in the world.
The projected area of the steel structure of the roof of the terminal building is 180,000 square meters, which is the size of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two arrival floors and two departure floors-F1-F4 is international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure, and international departure, respectively.
The double-decker bridge connecting the high-speed and the airport outside the terminal building corresponds to the terminals F3 and F4, respectively-the upper floors for international departures and both floors for domestic departures.
The first flight of Beijing Daxing International Airport opened the era of Beijing's "dual airports."
The new airport is positioned as a large international aviation hub, a new power source for national development, and a comprehensive transportation hub in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region that supports the construction of the Xiong'an New District. Up to now, a total of 66 airlines intend to settle in Beijing Daxing International Airport, of which 20 Airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions and foreign airlines, all airlines have been approved for flight schedules.
In the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes; it covers 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic destinations and 15 international destinations.
This has formed a "dual hub" airport pattern with Beijing Capital International Airport's coordinated development, moderate competition, and world-class competitiveness, which not only eases the operating pressure of Capital Airport's capacity saturation, but also better meets the rapid growth of air transportation in Beijing and surrounding areas The urgent need to effectively enhance the international competitiveness of my country's civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport has fully considered the geographical location, the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and operating environment. The airport runway has adopted the "omnidirectional" layout for the first time in China, using the world's largest air traffic control automation system, and establishing China's largest terminal control area can maximize the efficiency of aviation operations.
Airports of this scale in China have used the localized baggage automatic processing and information management system for the first time, using an innovative baggage transmission mode to improve the efficiency of baggage system processing.
The first flight of Beijing Daxing International Airport heralds the cool flight of Phoenix.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic firsts and has a localization rate of more than 98%, will surely have a direct and indirect economic impact on industries in the surrounding areas and inject vitality into Beijing's economic development.
MCA tentatively convenes a general meeting in November and plans to transfer to the party age to 16
MCA tentatively convenes the Central Congress in early November, and plans to revise the party constitution to lower the age of joining the party to 16 years.
As Congress passed a reduction in the voting age for general elections, MCA announced that it would hold the 66th Central Congress this year and proposed proposals to revise the party constitution, including a reduction in MCA's age for joining the party, from the existing 18 to 16 years old.
MCA President Datuk Seri Wei Jiaxiang said that the MCA Central Committee was originally scheduled to convene the Central Congress on November 2 and 3 this year, but due to the by-election of the Tanjung Biai National Assembly seat, the date of the conference may be changed.
He said that since the Election Committee will only meet on October 1 to finalize the nomination day and voting day of the Tanjung Biai National By-election, they will meet on the next day, October 2, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of convening the Central Committee yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the Congress and to revise the party constitution. It just happened that the Indigenous Solidarity Party Tanjung Biai MP Datuk Mohammad Farri died of illness and therefore joined the agenda of this national by-election.
Wang Boxiang, Secretary of Shandong Former Shouguang County Party Committee-Qiang County Fumin Chizi Xin-Xinhuanet
Wang Boxiang, born in Shouguang, Shandong, was born in February 1943. He joined the work in 1967 and has held positions of secretary of the township party committee, secretary of the county party committee, and mayor.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang served as secretary of the Shouguang County Party Committee of Shandong Province. At that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During his 5 years in Shouguang, Wang Boxiang held three things with the heart of the people in mind: one is to promote the industrialization of vegetables; the other is to develop the Shoubei saline-alkali beaches; the third is to lay the foundation for the industry to turn over, so that Shouguang people have since bulged up their pockets and raised their waists.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of vegetable cultivation and have also learned the lessons of vegetable cultivation.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers planted vegetables and harvested them, but they couldn't sell them and rotted in the ground.
Wang Boxiang's investigation found that the key to grasping vegetables is to improve circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in building a vegetable wholesale market and opened the prelude to the development of a market economy.
Party members and cadres should take the lead and mess up, and all losses will be borne by the county.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 party members including Sanyuan Zhucun Wang Leyi started 17 winter warm vegetable greenhouses. At that time, 17 "double ten thousand households" appeared in the village.
Subsequently, the county set up a promotion team. Under the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi toured and guided in various towns and villages; more than 5,000 vegetable greenhouses were promoted in the first year, and then the vegetable greenhouses were pushed to the whole county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million mu of land in Shoubei, in addition to saline-alkali beaches, are shallow beaches.
The local people's lives are very difficult.
Shounan has a vegetable greenhouse, what should Shoubei do?
Wang Boxiang organized more than 100,000 people to engage in a general battle and camped on the barren beaches for four or fifty days.
The leading cadres of Wang Boxiang and the county are all on the construction site. They are like a migrant worker. They are burdened by carts, and have dinner and sleep. When the people see them, they all extend their thumbs and admire in their hearts... At that time, Shoubei developed a 150,000 mu shrimp pond, 200,000 mu of salt fields and 600,000 mu of cotton fields have been developed on the saline-alkali beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang Industrial Conference as the secretary of the county party committee for the first time.
During the meeting, a "Comparative Table of Industrial Economic Numbers in 12 Counties and Districts of Weifang City" was issued. At first glance, the total industrial output value, Shouguang is not bad, ranking fourth.
But if the raw salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output value is only 119 million yuan, ranking third from the bottom.
Wang Boxiang took a group of more than 70 people and went to the field to "change his mind."
Less than a year after returning, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Since then, "learning missions" have been organized every year to study in Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
Shouguang lacks enterprises and entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over the convening of a special meeting: the director manager was publicly selected in the county, and 40 "entertained talents" stood out and were pushed to the front line of industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang Boxiang was transferred to the deputy mayor of Weifang.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4,854 enterprises, more than 100,000 "ten thousand households", and a cadre team recognized by the people. Shouguang people still affectionately call him "our Boxiang secretary."
On September 26 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the meeting of foreign ministers of China and the African members of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The current African Security Council member Côte d "Ivoire Foreign Minister Tano, Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Oyono, South African Foreign Minister Pandor, and the candidate member Niger Foreign Minister Kara, Tunisia Foreign Minister Jehinavi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.
First, rely on unity for strength.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism. The direct consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, and the role of the United Nations is impacted, harming the interests of the vast number of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, and unity can have strength.
In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will drive other countries to follow up and influence and shape the Security Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China and the African members of the Security Council have established a "3 + 1" coordination mechanism, and this coordination mechanism must be fully used.
Second, resolve disputes through consultation.
China has always advocated political solutions to hot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation and has experience in the successful mediation of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Security Council's agenda, especially African hotspots, are mostly the root cause of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We must make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and give full play to the role of the United Nations in good offices and mediation.
Third, rely on self-reliance for self-improvement.
African countries and people know Africa's problems best, and Africa also has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When dealing with hot issues in Africa, the Security Council should pay attention to listening to and respecting Africa's wishes, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with the African side and resolutely promote the capacity building of African independent peace operations.
Fourth, rely on development to govern fundamentally.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries. We must insist on putting economic and social development first and support each other's choice of development path.
China is willing to closely link the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" with the African Union's 2063 Agenda, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
We must work together to promote the United Nations to increase investment in Africa's development.
The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has once again erupted. China has and will continue to give full support, provide human and material assistance within its capacity, and is willing to coordinate operations with African countries to mobilize the United Nations and WHO to increase assistance and give full play to the United Nations. The role of the Congolese stabilization mission.
The neonatal department and other relays saved small lives.
thrilling!
The pregnant mother of the second child had an early attack. On the way to the hospital in a hurry, a 32-week premature baby couldn't wait to be born on the father's car co-driver.
Fortunately, obstetrics and neonatal doctors handled it in time, and the relay saved this little life.
Coincidentally, on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the Obstetrics and Neonatal Department of the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province received three premature babies on the road for three consecutive days, and the other two were born in 120 ambulances. Both are premature babies at 29 weeks.
Ms. Cheng is a pregnant mother with a second child. At 7 a.m. on September 19, she felt a little pain in her stomach, thinking that she was 32 weeks pregnant, and the first child was also born prematurely. She packed up the products to be prepared and went to the hospital after bathing.
After 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed it properly and asked her husband to drive from Xu Dong's home to the hospital.
Unexpectedly, shortly after the car left the house, the baby couldn't wait to be born on his father's car co-driver.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Cheng and her baby finally arrived at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Building of Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital.
The hospital security guard saw the panicked couple and baby and immediately notified the obstetrics delivery room. Deputy chief physician Zhang Huan and four other doctors and midwife Liu Yanyan took the delivery bag and umbilical cord tray and rushed downstairs.
"At that time, the mother was half lying on the co-driver of the car, with amniotic fluid and blood water under her body, and a baby boy was beside him, with an umbilical cord attached."
Zhang Huan asked that the baby was a 32-week premature baby. The parents didn't have time to cover the child on the way. The early autumn morning was already cool. He was cold and pale, without crying, and his limbs were paralyzed.
Liu Yanyan hurried to the co-driver to deal with the baby's umbilical cord, Zhang Huan went in from the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, wrapped the child's warmth with the treatment towel and the bag of the delivery bag, and cleaned the respiratory tract for the newborn (pictured), and then took the baby to the neonatal department on the 12th floor.
When the neonatologist heard the news, he rushed to the nurse's station to rescue the premature baby.
At that time, the baby's complexion was purple and there was suffocation and hypoxia. The doctor immediately gave him an intubation tube. Within a minute, the baby recovered his heartbeat, and his skin color gradually returned to rosy, and the recovery was successful.
After admission, the 32-week-old baby was on an invasive ventilator. After continuous rescue, his breathing was stable and he had successfully withdrawn the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable, breathing is smooth, and a small amount of breastfeeding has begun.
Coincidentally, on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the obstetrics and neonatal department of the hospital received three premature babies on the road for 3 consecutive days, and the other two were born in 120 ambulances, both 29 weeks premature babies, are currently actively treated in the neonatal department.
Sun Guoqiang, director of obstetrics and gynecology at the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital, said that in recent years, the provincial women and children have received many babies born on the subway and in private cars. Failure to deal with this situation may threaten the safety of the mother and child.
Director Sun reminded that pregnant mothers should come to the hospital immediately if they have abdominal pain, broken water, or redness.
In case of birth at home or on the road, the mother should lie down as much as possible, and you can put a blanket under the buttocks to prevent the baby from hitting the ground after delivery. The child should be kept warm immediately after delivery and be sent to the nearest hospital as soon as possible.

Up to three points for a free throw?
On the 27th, Beijing time, the NBA Development League announced the trial of a new free throw rule. Each free throw is only shot once, and the score is determined by the foul.
O'Neal has a very low percentage of free throws among NBA stars.
The new regulations stipulate that two-point shooting fouls can be scored 2 points, three-point shooting fouls can be scored 3 points, and fouls and penalties can be scored 1 point.
In the last two minutes of regular time and overtime, the previous free throw rules are used.

At present, many people believe that the new regulations may be beneficial to Harden, and James, who is relatively poor in free throws, will be "victimized."
Wuhan promotes the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises with a maximum subsidy of 20 million yuan
The reporter learned from the series of press conferences held by the Wuhan Municipal Government Information Office on the "Salute to the New China Welcome to the Military Games" city that this year, the city has accelerated industrial intelligent transformation and implemented transformation subsidies of up to 20 million yuan.

Zhang Hong said that at present, the city is organizing and implementing 373 intelligent transformation projects, with a total planned investment of 29.76 billion yuan, Hongxin Communications Huazhong's first 5G intelligent production line, Motorola's nation's leading intelligent mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens Transformer digital unmanned factory, aerospace science and industry's first batch of satellite production lines, Huisheng Bioworld's leading new veterinary drug intelligent production line, Oban intelligent home networking intelligent production line, etc.
In addition, Wuhan has also increased financial and financial support for intelligent transformation projects.
Among them, including the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, the investment will be completed according to their actual conditions; including investment in equipment hardware and RD soft investment, a transformation subsidy of 8% and a maximum of 20 million yuan will be granted.
At the same time, actively cooperate with financial institutions such as the Bank of Communications and the Wuhan Branch of Zhejiang Commercial Bank to provide personalized financial services specifically for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, and vigorously ease the pressure on corporate financing.
Trudeau's "human collapse", can he succeed in re-election?
This time it was Trudeau who dug out a little bit of the "big pit" that tripped Trudeau.
Recently, the Canadian media has exposed several old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau. In the photos, Trudeau dressed himself as a black man.
This is considered to be an obvious act of racial discrimination, which immediately caused uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians don't pay much.
Trudeau was a stone and hit his foot.
As pointed out by political commentator Riley and others, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been accusing high-profile accusations of opposition parties or dissidents within their own party of "major losses" in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever commits this error should be expelled immediately."
To put it simply, this time Trudeau stumbled out of the "big pit" that Trudeau himself dug a little bit.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He is young and handsome. He had a whirlwind of "political idols" when he debuted.
He was originally a "political amateur". After taking over as the head of the Federal Liberal Party, he fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative elections-the Federal Liberal Party had more than half of the seats in the lower house of the federal government and obtained valuable separate cabinet formation rights.
At that time, Trudeau put forward many deafening political platforms and ideas, such as "ethnicity and gender equality", "ecological and environmental protection", and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "unhealthy winds."
However, in his five years in power, he has been stubborn in almost all of the above aspects and "drove high and low."
Taking the issue of "ethnicity and gender equality" as an example, leaving aside the "black face" incident, he had previously "spoken but not true" on a series of issues related to indigenous peoples, allowing indigenous groups and leaders to move the protest tent to the gate of Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
In terms of eradicating corruption, at the end of last year and early this year, Trudeau was involved in the boiling "Lan Wanling Incident."
He was exposed to pressure the department and officials responsible for the investigation and punishment of the major violations of favoritism and fraud by the construction engineering company "Lan Wanling" in his hometown, demanding that the latter "raise your hand."
Moreover, Trudeau was angry with the officials who disclosed the fraud case after the incident-Wang Zhoudi mentioned earlier was the first Canadian Attorney General to disclose the fraud case and directly handle the case.
Although the case itself has doubts, the suspicions are difficult to scrub.
Many observers pointed out that Trudeau's five-year ruling collapse was mainly due to his "planing pits", and the biggest "pits" were "heads and tails", "self-reliance" and "wider self-discipline and stricter discipline."
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll data shows that since 2015, respondents who support Trudeau have slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their heads also performed poorly, even a considerable number of voters who are still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now dismissive of the federal prime minister and the head of the ruling party.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin. Can Trudeau repeat the drama that won five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether it is from the level of corporate competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, it has far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened to traffic.
The Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the Capital Airport is already in a state of over-saturation operation, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the capital's aviation service capabilities.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become my country's second city with two airports in the same city. It is similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serving domestic aviation affairs, while Pudong Airport is mainly based on international shipping aviation. In the future, Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also serve the differentiated positioning of different domestic and international aviation services and provide more subdivided services.
From the perspective of business development, the opening of Daxing Airport is more beneficial to Capital Airport.
Capital Airport's passenger throughput exceeded 100 million passengers in 2018, ranking first in the country, but compared with the rapidly growing business demand, there is still a significant capacity difference, especially the demand for international routes has a large gap.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for travel and business trips, and to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open and internationally integrated urban development trend, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, and plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers and cargo and mail throughput in the future 4 million tons.
Therefore, the positioning of the two airports does not overlap, and they have sufficient market space for different customer groups.
From the economic account level, the navigation of Daxing International Airport will obviously have a win-win effect, ease the tension in Beijing's aviation capacity, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and create an incremental cake for the dual-core operation of Capital Airlines.
From the user's point of view, with the navigation of Daxing International Airport, it is not necessary to focus on travel at Capital Airport in the future, but it can also reduce a series of problems caused by excessive route concentration, such as longer crossing guarantee time, slower passenger boarding speed, indirectly increase the time of aircraft and passengers staying at the airport, exacerbate the burden of airport operation, and reduce the burden of shipping through Capital Airport, in fact, it also improves the passenger travel experience.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of various transportation routes to large international airports, such as starting from the South Fifth Ring Road and going directly to the Daxing Airport Expressway, you can arrive in 50 minutes by driving, about 40 yuan for fuel money and 15 yuan for high-speed; and choosing the rail transit subway Daxing Airport Line, the distance is limited to 20 kilometers and 30 kilometers, the fare is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan; citizens can take Jingxiong intercity bus from Beijing West Railway Station to Daxing airport station for more than 20 minutes.
In general, citizens have a variety of transportation options to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a more reasonable range.
From the perspective of trend development: Daxing Airport is positioned as a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, so it is a little farther away from Beijing's urban area, but it has strengthened the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitated more people to travel, and driven the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin is of great significance.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, which can be seen from the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
The supporting transportation facilities of Daxing Airport are very complete. In addition to the new airport line directly to Daxing Airport in Beijing, there are several highways connecting Daxing Airport with the surrounding area.
This is just like passengers in cities such as Dongguan, Foshan, and Qingyuan in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via highways such as Guangfo and Guangshen. Residents in Langfang and Xiong'an New District around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport and obtain convenient and efficient aviation services.
It can be seen from this that the navigation of Daxing International Airport is not just the addition of several runways and several aircraft. Whether it is from the level of corporate competition, consumer experience, or regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, it has far-reaching impact and positive significance. It is not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, it provides diversified options for the travel of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei residents, promotes the improvement of the quality of services and the surrounding areas, and promotes the development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration.
Therefore, for the navigation of Daxing Airport, we must not only count individual accounts, but also account for the overall development of the economy.

2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Issues Forum Held in Chengtian Hue Province
Ruan Dejian, deputy director of the Vietnam National Assembly Economic Committee, revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new improvements and continued to maintain growth.
The forum focused on the prominent economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants exchanged in-depth views and opinions on the four themes of economic development in 2019 and the impact of some free trade agreements, some prominent issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, prominent issues in the Vietnamese social culture in 2019, and predictions and suggestions for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Delegates generally believed that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed and risks and challenges increased.
The trade friction between the major economies has further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has determined that despite the global economy full of uncertainty, 70% of the world's economies have fallen into a state of stagnation, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many gratifying achievements, the macro economy is running smoothly, and inflation is effectively controlled. In the first half of 2019, the consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64%, the lowest increase in the past three years.
In the first half of 2019, GDP growth was 6.76%, although it was lower than 7.05% in the same period last year, but compared with the level in the same period in the period of 2011-2017, the increase was still a relatively high level.
In forecasting the economic development trend of Vietnam in 2019-2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of the National Economic and Social Forecast Center of Vietnam, said that in the context of the turmoil in the world economy, the Vietnamese economy will show a high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro economy will continue to remain basically stable. The implementation of various free trade agreements will promote trade development, economic restructuring and business environment improvement will be further strengthened. Due to the impact of trade frictions, Vietnam's foreign export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring, forecasting and early warning mechanism, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnam's export commodities, look for opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, control the inflation rate to a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, director of the Consulate Office of the Chinese Embassy in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu Zhijie said that since the founding of New China 70 years ago, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programs to improve global economic governance and promote global common development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and also brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's livelihood.
Liu Zhijie said that as the world's second largest economy, China's contribution to world economic growth exceeds 30%, especially China's "Belt and Road" initiative, and cooperation between local provinces and cities in China and Siem Reap and territorial provinces continues to deepen.
He said that this year is the 61st year since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia. The two countries have brotherly friendship, and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Cambodia will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap Province highly praised the great achievements made by New China in the past 70 years and congratulated China and Cambodia on the achievements of friendly cooperation.
Di Saiha looks forward to the two sides continuing to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve the people's living standards.

Witness the ten years of "cloud rise" in digital China in Yunqi Town-Xinhuanet
If the 2009 local website forum is used as the origin, the 2019 Yunqi Conference held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has gone through a full decade.
From a concept of "cloud in the fog" to the practice of "cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies that support China's economic development, social management, and public services in 10 years.
In the Zhengtai New Energy photovoltaic cell workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, a new "colleague" loaded with Alibaba Cloud artificial intelligence was recently added to the quality inspector.
It is open 24 hours a day, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual, and the accuracy of quality inspection is stable at more than 95%.
According to the person in charge of the company, the "quality inspector" with a camera has concentrated on learning more than 40,000 defect samples. With the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and classify and place defective battery films.
This company is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing helping manufacturing transformation.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guidelines for Promoting Enterprise Cloud Implementation (2018-2020)" in 2018, and proposed that by 2020, strive to achieve a significant increase in corporate cloud awareness and enthusiasm, and the proportion of cloud adoption and application depth.
Alibaba Cloud founder Wang Jian said that today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for a digital economy where data is a key element.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, the scale of my country's cloud computing industry has also continued to expand.
According to the "Cloud Computing Development White Paper (2019)" released by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, China's overall cloud computing market size reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% from 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also unconsciously changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunqi Conference, the "Urban Brain", which appeared for three consecutive years, still attracts attention.
Alibaba Cloud introduced that at present, the city brain has changed from a traffic management tool to a city management center, and related cooperative applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception and artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain uses powerful computing capabilities to enable new city management service functions such as "parking before paying", "real-time perception of the number of patients", and "tourism route design."
In the field of government services, using "one cloud" to connect "one thing" to promote the "handheld office" and "handheld office" in concert, cloud computing has brought convenience to both ends of the supply of government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through government affairs.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and collected 19.08 billion pieces of data in 3066 categories.
The average amount of data transferred and shared between government departments in Zhejiang Province has reached 12 million times per month. Every time the data is transferred on the "cloud", it may mean that the masses do less work and run errands.
Use plastic tea bags with caution!
According to a report by the "Central News Agency", a recent Canadian study found that a pack of plastic tea bags may release billions or even tens of billions of plastic particles, which is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics a person ingests throughout the year, but so far there is no evidence that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
According to reports, researchers at Magill University in Canada found that immersing plastic tea bags in a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), tea bags will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nano plastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics a person ingests throughout the year.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles each year and inhales the same amount of microplastics.
It is reported that this study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology. Researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and cafes, opened the tea bags, washed the tea bags and dipped them in almost boiling water for 5 minutes, and then used an electron microscope and spectrometer for analysis.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several orders higher than the previous plastic load of other foods."
According to reports, most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many tea bag brands that use natural fibers still use plastic to seal them.
Some brand tea bags are no longer made of paper, and instead use plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the test objects of researchers.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic. Researchers define these microplastics to be between 100 nanometers and 5 millimeters in size, mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, and these microplastics can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first discovered plastic particles in human fecal samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea bags, the Canadian research team put daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics can affect the behavior of these daphnia and cause them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence so far that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO pointed out that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what impact they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that the reason why these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles may be that these plastic tea bags are in contact with boiling water. Even if the "edible grade" plastic is heated above 40 degrees Celsius, it may decompose or exude toxic substances.
Guterres said that climate emergencies are the biggest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, a natural disaster will erode the development achievements of a generation.
The disasters in Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas hit by hurricanes this year all illustrate this point.
About a quarter of people in small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 meters or lower.
The relocation may seriously affect their society and lifestyle, and even cause sovereignty and national identity issues.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island countries are working together to achieve carbon-neutral and 100% renewable energy by 2030, so they once again lead the world in the right direction.
Guterres said: "The climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over old ones.
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because these countries are in middle-income status, many countries are still caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must take action, and it is time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States. "
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for seeking help for small island developing States to manage disaster risk, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and urge international institutions to help small island developing States, especially middle-income countries with heavy debts, obtain funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the lifeline of the earth-the ocean.
The latest special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the ocean has suffered the severe consequences of the "swept" of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may experience extreme sea level rise that would only occur once a century.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification caused huge losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and in the past 40 years, plastic pollution has increased tenfold.
The needs of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island countries also face high costs of transportation, energy and infrastructure.
They rely heavily on some external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working hard to deal with the security impact of illegal human trafficking, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, this problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples that we can learn from all over the world. "
He emphasized that small island developing States are a special case of sustainable development.
They require long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
The Indian Ministry of Finance stated that the financial system has sufficient liquidity.
Indian Finance Minister Sitaraman said on the 26th that the current financial system has sufficient liquidity. Driven by holiday consumer demand, India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year.
Sitaraman made the above statement after holding meetings with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions.
Sitaraman did not specify where these remarks were targeted.
Some previous Indian media and overseas media blamed the continued slowdown of India's current economy on liquidity tensions in non-bank financial institutions.
Sitaraman cited the decline in car sales as an example, denying that liquidity is the main reason for the decline in sales.
Sitaraman pointed out that the decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Sitaraman predicts that driven by holiday consumption, India's economic growth may resume in the second half of the fiscal year.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping and consumption will greatly promote India's economic growth.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education recently issued a notice prohibiting all primary and secondary schools in the province from making up for violations during the National Day holiday, and organizing personnel to conduct random inspections and unannounced visits.
In the "Notice on the Prohibition of Violent Supplementary Courses on the National Day Long Holiday", the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education emphasized that primary and secondary schools everywhere should resolutely do so during the National Day: they must not organize students to make up lessons or take new lessons, and they must not hold subject training courses, special classes, Olympic classes, interest classes, improvement classes, etc., all campuses and school buildings must not be rented out to other educational institutions to hold various training courses.

Grasp the implementation of capable sows production, earnestly implement the subsidy policy for good sows, encourage pig breeding enterprises to expand the breeding scale of pigs, and systematically select excellent sows from the commercial pig group.
Grasp the implementation of investment attraction, and regard domestic well-known large-scale breeding enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the top priority for investment attraction.
Grasp the implementation of the market circulation system, speed up the construction of pig cold chain logistics facilities, and comprehensively promote the transition from "swapping" to "swinging."
To grasp the implementation of the modern epidemic prevention system, all localities should be equipped with grassroots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel that are compatible with the scale of breeding and work tasks, and build the first line of defense for epidemic prevention and control.
Sui Zhongcheng demanded that all efforts be made to ensure the supply of the meat market, ensure that there are no large-scale shortages and large-scale supply cuts, and ensure a stable supply of pork markets on major holidays.
The meeting also deployed on the continuous prevention and control of African swine fever epidemics, the prohibition and retreat of important waters in the Yangtze River Basin of our province, and the acquisition of mid-late rice in the province.
Representatives from Shanghai, such as the motherland, the national soul, the big white rabbit, etc., take party lessons for college students

"Some over-age migrant workers on some construction sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where to find young workers now?
There is no way to use so many "old people" on the construction site. "
Recently, Zou Kui, who has been a construction contractor for many years in the construction industry, exclaimed that there are many over-age migrant workers (over retirement age) on the construction site.
Recently, the college where the author works has carried out rainwater diversion projects. Many migrant workers have appeared on the campus. If you pay attention to observe, you will find that there are many over-age migrant workers.
Over-age migrant workers donot go out to work, but because they can't be idle, they have the helplessness and hardship of "having to do so"-whether they save money to solve their old-age and medical problems, or help their children, all drive these old people who should have been "idle" to continue to work hard.
The "old age" of over-age migrant workers is not as easy as we thought.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, reading for children, helping children build buildings and cars, helping children start a family, and raising grandchildren from generation to generation. When these migrant workers have completed their "life tasks", the money bags have been emptied and there are even a lot of debts, most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag down their children and to accumulate some more wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing until they can't do anything."
Many "post-80s", "post-90s" and even "post-00s" new generation migrant workers are reluctant to engage in difficult and labor-intensive secondary industries or low-end service industries, resulting in structural "labor shortages". These unattractive jobs provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of skills, physical functions and labor capabilities have declined, and many over-age migrant workers are doing work with high intensity, low income, high risk, and low security.
Being able to work one day is one day, earning a little more is a little bit, and the survival dilemma of over-age migrant workers behind "can not be idle" can not be ignored and ignored.
Solving the problems of arrears and wages, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labor income, and improving the living conditions of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their "self-salvation", is also inseparable from the institutional protection and humanistic care of the public sector.
Some scholars pointed out that over-age migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on home farming to solve their old-age care and medical problems. They must support their families through other means.
Understanding the helplessness and strength of over-age migrant workers "can not be idle" helps us better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the back of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs, and trying to make them return to the countryside truly "old and dependent", it requires the public sector, the market, and society to share responsibilities in a benign interaction, and it requires multiple efforts.
Chemetsov said that Russia will not export such a system in the next five years because "it must first supply its own army before exporting."
This approach is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their defense needs first before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grekhov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Air and Space Force, said that the development of the system is about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by "Diamond-Antai" Air and Space Defense Concein.
This is a new generation of air defense system that uses the working principle for destroying ballistics and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3500 kilometers.
In addition, according to certain information, the S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed 5 times the speed of sound, and even targets located in near space.
This weapon can also be integrated with other air defense systems into a unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense perspective.
Sergey Chemetsov expressed special attention to the S-400.
He said that the system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system entered the Arctic air defense regiment.
According to news on September 15, the modification of the S-400 air defense missile system by the Arctic Air Defense Regiment of Xindi Island has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defense stated that this is entirely a process within the transition plan to a more advanced defense tool in the northern strategic direction.
The Russian Northern Fleet Information Office said: "With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has increased significantly."
Very importantly, according to military assessment, the system has been used successfully in the extreme north and Arctic regions.
The officers and men of the air defense regiment trained on the new system and prepared to enter combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, part of it is still retained.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons that can destroy various air targets, whether they are high-speed flying targets at high altitudes or "leaking fish" close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 "Triumph" system developed by "Golden Diamond-Antai" Air and Space Defense Concein is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air attack weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 kilometers per second within a distance of 60 kilometers.
Russia never conceals that it will supplement the deployment of air defense forces in the extreme north to ensure the safety of airspace on the northern sea route.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of "Tor-M2DT" air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic. They are enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defense stated at that time that the Arctic "Thor" troops will be expanded to a complete brigade-level system in the future.
Coupled with the newly deployed S-400 long-range system on Xindi Island and the Kola Peninsula and the "Pantsir-SA" short-range system deployed in the extreme north, these advanced air defense weapons effectively defend Russia's polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defense.
According to the idea of the Russian government, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As a Russian store operator, Russian multi-product company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Most Russian products have online stores in China's largest trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, and multi-functional instant messaging software Wechat. It has its own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russian Pinto to formulate store marketing strategies and participation standards, and screen companies that put products on virtual shelves.
The store plans to open before the end of this year and list products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to information from the Russian Export Center, the total monthly visits to China's e-commerce platforms are as high as 1 billion.
At the same time, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014, and have exceeded US $1 billion in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores within the framework of the global import strategy to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display products from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and sales of 500 million rubles are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods, and regard our products as high-quality and green products. "
Kozhevnikov said that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying.
He said: "Our goal is ambitious to launch 500 businesses through this store within three years."
At the same time, the platform will also list products of companies in the Russian Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor at the Basic Department of Trade Policy of Plekhanov University of Economics in Russia, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both parties, because the Russian export center is a state-owned rather than a private institution."
"I haven't seen a lot of highly competitive Russian goods in the market."
He believes that the project may not be actually implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of more than 170 Russian companies has been published on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be purchased in China or other countries.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, that is, a training project for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University. Its first seminar was held in July this year.
In November this year, the Russian Export Center will also serve as an organizer for Russian companies to participate in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the Second China International Import Expo in Shanghai.
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall, where it will also become the center for holding commercial project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, promotional meetings and talks with representatives of Chinese companies.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Office of the Russian Export Center said: "In addition to the agricultural booth, we will also hold business meetings, that is, arrange direct contact between entrepreneurs."
"This is another direction of our efforts to support enterprises and ensure that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them."
In addition, the Expo will also hold master classes, cooking competitions and Russian food tasting sessions cooked by famous Russian chefs in the "Explore Russian Food Shanghai Station" project.

Xinhua Times Commentary: Resolutely move our own way
The white paper "China and the World in the New Era" released on the 27th answered: Over the past 70 years, China's development has been successful. The fundamental reason is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and walked unswervingly along this path.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people that China takes a development path that suits itself.
In modern times, in an environment of poverty, weakness, internal and external troubles, generations of benevolent people have sought and succeeded on the road to saving the country and the people.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, and the presidential system have all been thought and tried, and the results will not work."
It was not until the Communist Party of China and New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road China has embarked on is the road to the happiness of the Chinese people, the road to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the road to the common development of China and all countries in the world.
It is precisely because China is on the right path that China can do its own thing well, become the world's second largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continuously benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path conforms to China's national conditions and adapts to the requirements of the times. It will show brighter development prospects as the times progress.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find a correct path; looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish this correct path even more.
The Chinese understand the truth of Nan'an Beizhi, understand that what suits others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, and only what suits them is the best.
It is with this kind of road self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that attracts worldwide attention.
In the tortuous process of human progress, the "historical final conclusion" was once famous.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics declares the end of the "historical final conclusion", the collapse of the "China collapse theory", and the failure of the "socialist failure theory."
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve national prosperity and strong people, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and lessons for those countries and nations in the world that want to accelerate development and maintain their independence, and take the path that suits their national conditions.
The world is colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path that suits their national conditions.
China does not "import" the foreign model, nor does it "export" the Chinese model, but will unswervingly take its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen governance and political exchanges with other countries, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket owner dismissed a 66-year-old female worker via text message because he was more willing to hire employees from Asian backgrounds. The boss's approach was slammed as "shameful."
The committee said that Jianbin Wang, the owner of Ms. Gail Ayton, who has worked in the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, treats employees "extremely unfairly" and may violate anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and he has always "wanted to fire me" because she is not Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, vice chairman of the committee, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang has published some recruitment advertisements in various Australian Chinese employment forums in the past."
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one said "preferred Asian lady" and the other said "preferred Asian employee."
The third post said that he "more inclined to overseas people (sic)."
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton via text message in April this year, and later said it was due to her absence and the alleged lack of cash at the cash register from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reason for firing Ms. Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.
She has only been absent from work for one shift in the past three years, and the "missing amount" totals several Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was "actually unrelated to her behavior or performance."
He said: "In my opinion, supported by the evidence of the recruitment advertisement released by Mr. Wang, the real motivation for the respondent to dismiss her is that he is more willing to hire employees with Asian backgrounds.
According to Article 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's behavior ostensibly constitutes a violation of anti-discrimination laws and/or the dismissal of the applicant is illegal. "
Mr. Sams said that in view of Mr. Wang's "horrible" treatment of Ms. Ayton, it was inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, who is a temporary worker with an hourly wage of AUD 26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labor relations legislation, Sams said he will submit his ruling and documents to the committee director to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be transferred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He said that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the reason for allegedly dismissing her.
He said: "I think that the respondent has adopted an incurable unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant. Mr. Wang" waits "for this opportunity, which he believes will" prove "that the termination of the applicant's employment is justified."
"He was wrong... The respondent completely ignored any natural and fair treatment given to her when she expelled the applicant. What is shocking is that he was rude and extremely unfair."
Mr. Sams said that although Foodworks is a small business, "but it must be frankly stated that no decent employer will dismiss employees in the extremely unfair and perfunctory manner admitted in this case."
He said: "This is shameful and extremely unfair."

Six people denied that the sale of fake Malaysian papers was submitted to the High Court for trial
Six men suspected of forging and selling my country's passports, birth certificates and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Registration Bureau and a Datuk-level businessman, appeared in court on Thursday. The court judge approved the allegations of anti-human trafficking and anti-trafficking in immigrants and transferred them to the High Court for trial.
Among them, the defense lawyer who originally represented Datuk's Chinese-American defendant Li Zhenhua (transliteration), and also a member of Congress in the Sunset Dong District, Rael, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the case, that is, he no longer became the defendant's representative lawyer and was approved in court.
He said that because he represented the defendant, he attracted criticism from political opponents, and his DAP was also implicated.
He emphasized that he was not afraid of any threats, but he did not want to be used by irresponsible units to defame the DAP and the Pakatan Harapan government or other Pakatan Harapan leaders, so he made this decision after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendant and being a member of Congress, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any defendant. So far, the defendant Li Zhenhua has not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged in court on September 12 this year. In the face of multiple allegations of Article 26E of the Anti-Human Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking Immigration Act and Article 466 of the Criminal Code (forged documents), they all denied guilt and were not approved by the court for bail pending trial.
On Thursday, two court judges Nosha Ha and Mazlan approved the prosecution's application after the prosecution's statements, and transferred the allegations of the six defendants' anti-human trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration laws to the High Court for trial; as for the allegation of forged documents, they will appear in the court on October 3, waiting for the prosecution to hand over the documents to the defense.
The previous six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA), so the judge did not grant bail.
Walking with the motherland-a sketch of a certain team of the Armed Police Force
Jin Qiu, on the parade training ground, a certain team of the Armed Police Force composed of officers and men with an average height of 1.83 meters was busy training.
The shining spears, the unique olive green and the bright red epaulets form a beautiful landscape.
A few days ago, the reporter walked into this square team and felt the determination of the armed police officers and soldiers to be the loyal guards of the party and the people forever, as well as their feelings and pursuit of "honor first."
"Dream shines a glorious life and writes an immortal legend in the new era..." This is a team song created by the Fang team officers and soldiers collectively-"Walking with the Motherland. "
In the square team, this song is the motto of every player.
Qi Xiaoguang, who is 1.92 meters tall, is particularly prominent in the square team.
As the flag bearer of the former Armed Police National Flag Guard, he has a deeper understanding of honor.
The honor of soldiers comes from hard training.
Qi Xiaoguang, as a flag bearer, has been training to high standards and strict requirements.
He tied a sandbag to practice stereotypes, stuck a stopwatch to practice pace, covered his eyes to practice stride, and practiced stability against the strong wind.
In his "Qingqi career", there is a picture that is always unforgettable.
During a flag-raising ceremony, heavy rain poured down, but none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the flag was raised, Qi Xiaoguang deeply felt the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Qi Xiaoguang was selected as the base soldier to be read.
The standard movements of the base soldier and the flag bearer are different.
Qi Xiaoguang introduced that although the pace of progress of the flag bearer and the base soldier is only more than 20 steps, more effort is required in training.
The base soldier is the first in the first row and directly determines the order of the square team.
After the military parade focused on training, he kicked his legs repeatedly every day and practiced hard kicks.
In the demonstration, his precise stride and pace won applause from officers and men.
In the square team, almost every officer and soldier has the same experience as Qi Xiaoguang.
The father of fighter Zhu Xudong participated in the military parade for the 50th anniversary of National Day 20 years ago.
In order to follow in his father's footsteps and become a member of the Fang team, he suffered setbacks again and again, but he was never discouraged.
He said: "It is the glory of my life to be able to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father and accept the review of the party and the people. I am willing to endure any hardships."
Entering the honor room of the Fang team, the eight characters of "The Capital's Elite Master" are in sight.
Wang Qian, political commissar of the Fang team, introduced that all the members of the Fang team are from the Beijing Armed Police Corps-this is a unit with a glorious tradition. It has undertaken major tasks such as the founding ceremony, the National Day celebrations, the security of the previous party's National Congress and the maintenance of the capital's anti-terrorism. To cultivate a large number of British model collectives and individuals, more than 50 units and individuals have been awarded the title of honor by the State Council, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Forces.

The scene of the TV series "Hunting Fox" reproduces the style of the police
The episode "Hunting Fox", a theme of transnational escape and investigation, was recently filmed on the spot at Tianjin Airport. Actors such as Wang Kai and Wang Ou filmed important scenes such as escorting economic suspects back to China. The shooting process was supported by China Southern Airlines.
The "Hunting Fox" crew filmed the key scene at the airport that best demonstrated the law enforcement achievements of "Hunting Fox"-members of the Hunting Fox Action Team chased the fugitives back to the country, took off the plane, and signed an arrest warrant.
The crew filmed multiple scenes such as the apron, customs border inspection, and aircraft cabins and doors, reproducing the arduous course and professional style of China's front-line investigative police and fox hunting heroes flying in multiple countries to arrest fugitive criminals.
In order to successfully complete the shooting, the main team of "Hunting Fox" carried out a lot of preliminary preparations, repeatedly confirming each execution detail to ensure the most real and direct visual effect.
It is reported that the play will also be filmed in many places abroad.
Vietnam must seize opportunities for the development of artificial intelligence.
The four criteria used to evaluate and rank the readiness of cities to face the AI wave include prospects, realization capabilities, asset base and development direction.
The city of Singapore ranks first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert from the organization, responded to a reporter's interview for Mosin Pevanne: "When reviewing and evaluating cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, I find it very meaningful.
Overall, I think that in the context of high growth rate, strong economic development path, and rapid development of the talent base, Vietnam's future is very bright.
I think Vietnam is on the right path and is doing very well.
It is important that Vietnam should know how to use the opportunities brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote more economic development. "
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people's work, communication and lifestyle.
It brings higher efficiency, but it also threatens to exacerbate social, economic and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, only any city in the world today is ready for a breakthrough in the era of artificial intelligence.

About 800 million people traveled on the National Day to reflect China's booming tourism supply and demand
About 800 million people will travel in the upcoming "Eleventh" Golden Week!
Big data from several tourism platforms shows that the supply and demand of my country's tourism consumer market are both prosperous.
The Ctrip National Day Tourism Report predicts that, with reference to previous National Day tourism statistics, it is expected that the number of domestic tourists during the National Day holiday this year will be close to 800 million; in addition, there will be more than 7.5 million outbound tourism.
At present, tourists from more than 500 cities use this platform to book products such as group tours, free travel, customized tours, and local fun, involving 100 countries and regions.
According to estimates by the China Tourism Research Institute, the country received 726 million domestic tourists during the National Day holiday last year, a year-on-year increase of 9.43%.
Not only will the number of tourists reach a new high this year during the National Day holiday, but consumption upgrade will also become the "main theme" of travel during the National Day holiday.
Ctrip reports that the per capita cost of domestic cross-provincial tourism during the National Day holiday exceeds 3,000 yuan, an increase from the same period last year. This is because tourists generally choose products with better experience, such as high-rated brand hotels, no-shopping tour groups, exquisite small groups, special cars, etc.
The booking data of Donkey Mom Tourism Network shows a similar trend. Domestic long-term use of comfortable models and "private groups" of less than ten people are more popular than in previous years.
Spring and Autumn tourism data shows that its consumers prefer "calm and slow" that emphasizes experience, service, and differentiation.
According to data from Flying Pig, the number of tourists booking in my country's fourth-tier and below cities has grown the fastest, with a year-on-year growth rate of 30%, reflecting the consumption upgrade of residents in more parts of the country.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's "Eleventh" Golden Week tour.
Ctrip data shows that orders for car rental self-driving tours during the National Day holiday are expected to increase by nearly 60% year-on-year, and short-distance self-driving tours exploring nearby niche routes continue to be popular; the number of private group applicants has increased by 155% year-on-year.
Sharing joy has become the main purpose of people's travel and leisure.
According to Ctrip data, 28% of tourists during the National Day holiday are parent-child guests, 25% are couples traveling, and 23% are colleagues and friends traveling together.
In terms of the age of tourists, "post-80s" and "post-90s" account for more than 50% of the total number of tourists.
It is worth noting that, unlike the more rapid growth of outbound travel in the past Golden Week, the performance of the domestic travel market this year is more "eye-catching."
According to data from Flying Pig, the number of people booking domestic cultural travel routes during the National Day holiday this year increased by 42% year-on-year, and the growth rate exceeded that of outbound travel.
According to industry analysis, while the demand is strong, reforms on the tourism supply side are being promoted across the country to provide tourists with a richer "cultural tourism feast."
For example, the State General Administration of Sport and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have jointly released the "11th Golden Week Sports Tourism Fine Lines in 2019"; the Shanghai Tourism Festival 2019 is being held to launch 100 cultural and tourism activities in 7 sectors to attract Chinese and foreign tourists; approaching Golden Week, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces have introduced scenic spot ticket price reduction or free measures.
Ctrip booking data shows that destinations with unique natural scenery or cultural characteristics in China are the most "hot", and Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin will be the most popular domestic tourist destination cities.

China is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
An animal protein analyst at Rabobank said that after the outbreak of African swine fever, China is facing a severe shortage of pork and is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
After the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins. The outbreak caused the authorities to destroy many herds. In the past year, the number of live pigs in China has halved and pork prices have almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world's pork.
Chenjun Pan, a senior animal protein analyst at the Dutch Cooperative Bank of China, said that the demand for other meats, including beef, has increased, and China, the world's largest importer of animal protein, currently accounts for 27% of the world's pork imports, and beef imports account for 24% of the world.
Ms. Pan said that in the first half of this year, China's beef imports from Australia increased by 65%. China surpassed the United States and Japan and became Australia's largest beef export market.
Yesterday, the Chinese government stated that it would release more pork from the emergency reserve before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.

The world's oldest barber died at the age of 108 and cut his hair for 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest barber certified by King's World Records in New York, USA, has never retired at the age of 108. He has been diligently cutting hair for guests every day, but on the 19th, Mancinelli died of complications of jaw cancer and bid farewell to his 96-year haircut life.
According to a "CNN" report, Mancinelli immigrated to the United States when he was 8 years old. It didn't take long to help clean the floor at a barber shop. At the age of 12, he started picking up scissors to serve guests, thereby reducing the financial pressure on the family.
Although Mancinelli attended elementary school at the time, he did not graduate.
Roberto, the son of Mancinelli, revealed that his father loves work, and people from all over the world also like him, but although his father has always been healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and finally due to physical factors 6 weeks before his death Unable to go to work, but this is not retirement, because he plans to come back and cut his hair when he gets better.
82-year-old Robert said that after his father's death, he must now find a new barber because he has asked his father to help cut his hair throughout his life.
The repurchase scale of listed companies exceeded 100 billion yuan in the year, a record high-Xinhuanet
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have frequently repurchased shares in the past two years. Through targeted repurchases and collective bidding transactions, they hope to pass the information that the company's value is underestimated to the market, so as to stabilize the stock price and enhance investor confidence.
According to Oriental Fortune Choice data, the funds used by listed companies to repurchase shares in 2017 were 7.9 billion yuan, which surged to 51 billion yuan in 2018. Since 2019, the total amount of repurchase implementation of A-share listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan, a record high in A-share repurchase funds, and far exceeding previous years.
From the perspective of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares and the majority shareholder's shareholding seem to be the same, but there are great differences in the implementation subject, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchase, and the equity of the stock itself.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mai Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with a reporter from the Securities Daily that the "Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares" issued in November 2018 addressed the problems of the current system such as the narrow scope of share repurchases, complicated decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory systems. Since listed companies have been encouraged to repurchase shares from the policy perspective, the phenomenon of repurchase of shares has increased significantly that year.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially issued the "Implementation Rules for Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares". The introduction of these policies has broadened the source of funds for listed companies to repurchase funds, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged various types of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the opinion was issued, the operation of share repurchase by listed companies has more applicable situations, the repurchase process is easier, and the enthusiasm for share repurchase is also greater.
Repurchasing shares at a relatively low position is also conducive to listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, increasing the rate of return on net assets, and reducing the pressure on the company's profit indicators.
Compared with the increase in shareholding by major shareholders, the repurchase of shares by listed companies is more significant, which also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and sufficient cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the underestimation of the stock price is the main factor for the repurchase of listed companies. The company's stock price can no longer reflect the company's future development prospects. Therefore, such companies deserve investors' attention, but they can not invest blindly and need to pay attention to the financial reports and specific operating conditions of such listed companies.
Listed companies with large-scale repurchases have at least demonstrated the company's development confidence and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for the repurchase of A-share listed companies has gradually increased, which has also normalized the repurchase behavior. The data shows that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
China Ping An recently disclosed the progress of the repurchase, saying that the company has accumulatively repurchased 57.59 million shares of A shares through centralized bidding transactions, accounting for 0.315% of the company's total share capital, and the total amount of funds paid is 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs). The repurchased shares will all be used for employee stock ownership plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that the company's shareholders' meeting has considered and adopted.
Yili shares have paid 5.792 billion yuan for share repurchases, and recently adjusted the use of repurchased shares, from the original plan "repurchase shares will be used as the source of stock incentives for later implementation of equity" to "cumulative repurchase 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares are used for stock incentives, and the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used for cancellation to reduce registered capital."
Yili shares said that the cancellation of some of the shares that have been repurchased will help to further increase the level of earnings per share and effectively increase the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on September 25, showing that TCL Group has repurchased 3.59% of the company's shares in total, at a cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
The office of the TCL Group Board of Directors told the "Securities Daily" reporter that the repurchase of shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans, equity incentives or for the conversion of convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improves its competitiveness and continues to develop healthily.
Based on confidence in the company's future development and the maintenance of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's stocks in the secondary market in the past year, and comprehensively considering the company's operating and financial conditions and other factors, the company plans to use its own funds, self-raised funds and other financing methods to repurchase company shares.
Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Open Source Fund, said that the operation of repurchasing stocks by listed companies can reduce the number of shares in the market and increase the earnings per share of listed companies, which is an important benefit for the stock price of the secondary market; In addition, listed companies are willing to take out real money and repurchase stocks from the stock market to write off, which greatly boosted market confidence.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially for high-performing stocks. It is a very good way to boost investor confidence through share repurchases, and it is also a practice that deserves recognition and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and the four heads of the Xiangjun Army of Engineering Machinery Manufacturing-Zhan Chunxin, Liang steadily, He Qinghua, and Liu Feixiang, set a "small goal" around "Changsha from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing"-three or five years later to build the world's leading level of construction machinery industry cluster.
To build a world-leading construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha, in the current fashionable words, it is to build "the strongest surface."
As the capital city of the inland province, Changsha shouted this bold speech, where did it come from?
Relying on the strength of domineering side leakage.
The four Hunan-based construction machinery companies participating in the dialogue all have their own skills, covering the entire field of heaven, underground, sea and land: Shanhe Intelligent Light Aircraft, Zhonglian Heavy Industry's concrete delivery pump, Sany Heavy Industry's all ground Crane, iron construction heavy industry's tunnel shield machine, its "hard power" can be described as unrivalled in the world and proud of the heroes.
Once upon a time, China basically had no say in the field of construction machinery manufacturing.
Time-shifting, Chinese companies "introduced" and "went out" two-wheel drive, took the Dongfeng initiative of the "Belt and Road" initiative, acquired, merged, and set up factories, and became a leader in the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, Sany Heavy Industry, Zhonglian Heavy Industry, Iron Construction Heavy Industry, Shanhe Intelligent and other leading construction machinery enterprises, their output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators have greatly led similar enterprises.
Relying on the current situation that the camera moves.
The "Four Kings" of the construction machinery Hunan Army are the leaders of the Changsha construction machinery industry cluster and the leading enterprise in the global construction machinery industry.
In the rivers and lakes of the global industry, whoever survives and lives well is the tough thing to talk about.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a cold winter, and many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing companies fell down, but Changsha's construction machinery manufacturing enterprises regarded "cat winter" as "winter swimming", adding pressure and self-breaking through the industrial structure Transformation from manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing not only survived, but also strengthened the body and bones.
Relying on the strength of the government and enterprises that the stars hold the moon.
The development of advantageous industries requires both active enterprise and active government action.
The reason why Changsha has the reputation of "the capital of construction machinery" is that it has gathered the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, created many related industrial clusters, and released it by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, and simplifying the approval process. Service measures, the cost of RD, manufacturing, and sales of enterprises has been greatly reduced.
A good business ecology makes construction machinery manufacturing enterprises come in droves.
History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of building a leading level of global construction machinery.
Whether it is the government, enterprises, or even related industry, academia, research and other links, we should seize opportunities, follow the trend, set goals, and continue to work hard to contribute to the construction of a manufacturing power in Hunan.
Wang Yi chaired the meeting of foreign ministers of China and the African members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that China and African countries are good brothers and good partners.
Whether it is past, present or future, China stands firmly with African brothers.
We advocate the holding of this foreign ministers' meeting, which is a concrete measure of the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum last September. It is to strengthen the unity and cooperation between China and African countries in the Security Council.

Qingyang, Gansu: Hu Yangtuo came to the "Poverty Relief Classic."
The autumn of September renders the Loess Plateau.
In Yima Town Yimin Breeding Professional Cooperative, 58-year-old villager Xia Weili filled the trough in the sheepfold with the last shovel of grass, stood by the trough, and watched the white lake sheep chew.
"It's delicious. It won't sell for a good price until it is fat in autumn and winter."
Xia Weili said that he feeds sheep "special nutritious meals" every day, cleans them regularly, sterilizes and disinfects them, and does not dare to neglect them by careful service.
Xia Weili has raised sheep for more than 20 years. He didn't know how extensive the sheep were in the past until he came to work in the cooperative.
Xia Weili is from Xia Yuanchi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His left and right houses are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional free-range method, the quality of sheep is poor, and the number of flocks is small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Xia Weili immersed himself in research and breeding all day long, because he always held a strong heart.
The people who bought shares are all poor households. They all trust the sheep to the cooperative. Whether they can pay dividends and sell at the end of the year, they all count on him.
Fortunately, under the guidance of technicians, he slowly learned to engage in epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few breeding "good practices" in the village.
Yimin Breeding Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that the standardized sheep sheds have doorways inside and outside.
"Wool is thick and prone to bacteria. Lake sheep can't wait in hot and humid places. Sheep sheds must be built on three sides surrounded by grooves, and a fan must be installed to ventilate and heat."
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent epidemic, the sheep shed needs to be sprayed and disinfected regularly, and the sheep should be vaccinated three to four times in the first quarter.
In addition to living well, the "little fat sheep" must also eat grass mixed with silage corn, wheat grass, alfalfa, etc., and have a "playground" wide enough to stretch the bones.
The cooperative adopts the method of trusteeship, and guides local farmers to put well-planted lake sheep here, unified breeding, management, and sales, and achieve improved breeding, scientific, standardized, and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep shares pay more than 6,000 yuan per household each year, and there are 4 poverty alleviation targets for building stalls to work in cooperatives.
From "full mountain grazing" to "precision feeding", from "local mating" to "artificial insemination", from "looking at body shape, touching the belly" to "doing B-ultrasound one by one..." In Qingyang, Gansu, sheep breeding is not just a change in feeding methods. The model of "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" has changed the scene of "sheep breeding on the hillside and selling sheep in the market", overcoming the weakness of traditional agriculture and animal husbandry, and the poor days of farmers. Because modern sheep farming is getting better.
Zou Tao said that if market prices are weak, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd. will purchase at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers diversify market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, General Counsel of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that by providing services such as loan guarantees, supply of sheep breeds, order breeding, purchase of quotations, unified processing and sales to poor households, more and more poor households are driven to read the "Sheep Sutra."
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor households have achieved stable income growth through forage breeding, improved breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughtering and segmentation, and market sales of Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.
Qingyang City is located in the northern agricultural and animal husbandry interlaced zone, with rich forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale sheep breeding farms and cooperatives in the city. The number of sheep breeding is more than 5 million, and two processing lines for slaughtering 1.3 million sheep are also being built. The flock is becoming the "leader" in poverty alleviation in the industry.
French finance minister says next year will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros and calls on Germany to follow up
Reuters, Paris, September 26-French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, and Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive the sluggish economy.
Lemaire said in introducing France's 2020 budget that the European Central Bank's latest monetary easing measures have created an opportunity for increased investment for those member governments that have the ability to afford it.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on September 12, and plans to restart debt purchases to lower borrowing costs, hoping to use this to inspire economic recovery and boost inflation.
"Low interest rates will not allow Europe to return to prosperity. Monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough", Lemaire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, it needs it now, the sooner the better. Don't wait until the situation worsens before acting", he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented a tax cut of more than 10 billion euros this year, which has greatly boosted France's economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, and the German economy that depends on exports bears the brunt.
Lemaire pointed out that the tax burden on French families next year will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros, including 5 billion euros in income tax relief.
In addition, with the gradual implementation of the corporate tax rate from 33.3% to 25% over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Study: U.S. National Healthy Diet Index Increases Slightly but Still Challenges-China News Network
China News Service, September 27th, according to the American Overseas Chinese News Network, a recent study in the United States shows that in the past 16 years, the US government's healthy eating index has increased moderately, from 56 to 58.
But with a perfect score of 100, this is not worth celebrating.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that Americans still consume too much food that may cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases among American nationals.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study is based on the conclusions of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the US government from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write, "Despite considerable improvements, significant dietary challenges still exist."
It is reported that these challenges include allowing US nationals to reduce their intake of snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, butter and other foods containing saturated fats.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended upper limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the US national diet is the reduction of sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officials believe that the daily intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
The researchers believe that the reason for the reduction in intake of sugar is related to the reduction in people drinking sweet soda, but Zhang Fangfang emphasized that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomato sauce.
Adults in the United States have increased their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole-grain foods slightly.
However, data from 2016 shows that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although people's intake of salt is slightly reduced, and the reduction in drinking juices has led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang Fangfang said that they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on personal health surveys that are conducted every two years, and these surveys will allow adults to recall the food they ate in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's dietary guidelines for American residents recommend that people adopt a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guide points out that people should consume more nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs, and seed foods that can provide protein.
During the survey, the number of people with diabetes in the United States almost doubled, more than 7%, and the obesity rate has also increased over the years between the surveys-about 70% of American adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease is still the leading cause of death for US nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Ruan Wenping, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, secretary of the Central Secretariat, and minister of the Central Economic Department, led a delegation to attend the forum.
According to the close cooperative relationship between the EU and individual partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of this forum is "Achieving the Connection between the EU and Asia: Building a Bridge for a Sustainable Future."
The forum was held one year after the implementation of the docking strategy on the two continents of the European Union.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that strengthening the connection is part of the above proposition because it brings benefits to the people and economies of the countries concerned.
The above relationship helps bring stability and prosperity to all parties concerned.
He also believes that the EU wants to convey messages about enhancing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial connection between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a special guest of the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary meeting.
The nation's first joint-stock financial management subsidiary was established to use technology to empower asset management business
On the 26th, Everbright Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary Everbright Wealth Management Co., Ltd. was officially established in Qingdao. This is the first joint-stock bank wealth management subsidiary established in my country.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of a financial management subsidiary by a bank is conducive to its use of technology to enhance its asset management business.
In April this year, Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank issued separate announcements saying that they had been approved by the China Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission to prepare for the construction of wealth management subsidiaries.
On September 24, Everbright Bank announced that Everbright Wealth Management has officially been approved to open.
Just two days later, Everbright Bank led many joint-stock banks and was the first to establish Everbright Wealth Management in Qingdao.
Everbright Group Chairman Li Xiaopeng said that Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern technological thinking and methods, rely on big data, Internet of Things, cloud computing, improve the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, and improve customer acquisition, happiness and security.
By 2021, establish and improve the "four beams and eight pillars" of my country's financial technology development, further enhance the financial industry's technology application capabilities, achieve deep integration of finance and technology, and coordinated development, and significantly enhance the people's satisfaction with digital, networked, and intelligent financial products and services.
Everbright Financial Chairman Zhang Xuyang introduced that Everbright Financial's asset management platform will use intelligent investment, intelligent investment research, big data and other technologies to help Everbright Financial better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, a special researcher at the National Finance and Development Laboratory, said that under the new competition situation facing the asset management industry, financial technology companies and asset management institutions will use asset management technology to jointly explore new growth paths.
Financial technology empowers the asset management industry, which is not only the need for the transformation and development of financial technology itself, but also injects new vitality and vitality into the development of asset management business.
At the beginning of this year, Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new asset management technology system to enhance the product development and wind control capabilities of asset management with the help of technology and digital methods.
The new system starts with the four major capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management, and risk assessment to improve the overall intelligent operation level of the asset management industry.
Experts believe that while asset management technology improves customer service capabilities and innovates rich products, it can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve asset management efficiency.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, the risk bias of customers through questionnaires was easy to be biased, but now the use of artificial intelligence for user portraits helps to better locate customers, launch corresponding products according to customers' investment preferences, and help resolve risks.
"Alternative big data such as e-commerce and spatio-temporal data can help us better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry."
Zhang Xuyang said that while mitigating risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
The deepest record of China's railway tunnel shaft is refreshed
China News Agency, Baoshan, September 27th (Zhang Weiming, Xu Weiguo, Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the No. 1 shaft of Gaoligongshan Tunnel of Dali (Li) Rui (Li) Railway was completed on the 27th. The well depth reached 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the deepest record of China's railway tunnel shafts, and this record was created under a large amount of water inrush.
The Darui Railway Gaoligongshan Tunnel with a total length of 34.5 kilometers is located in Yunnan. The tunnel traverses the Gaoligongshan Mountains from the west bank of the Nu River and is the longest single-hole single-track tunnel in Asia.
This tunnel traverses 19 fault zones and has a maximum burial depth of 1155 meters. Because it covers almost all the bad geology and major risks that tunnel construction may encounter, the Gaoligongshan Tunnel is called the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of Gaoligongshan Tunnel, shouldering the important task of increasing the working surface to achieve "long tunnel short hit" and later railway operation ventilation.
The successful excavation of shaft No. 1 to the bottom of the shaft indicates that the Gaoligongshan Tunnel has officially entered the construction of a horizontal tunnel. After excavation and equipment replacement at the bottom of the shaft, four working surfaces can be added underground to speed up the excavation of the tunnel.
"The shafts are all in granite formations. Because there are many cracks in the granite formations, they can't stop the water, and they keep flowing from top to bottom. Basically, there is as much water pressure as the well."
Si Jingzhao, chief engineer of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau Darui Railway Project Department, told reporters that during the construction of the shaft, there were many dangers such as mud and water inrush and collapse. The builder invited experts to check the pulse on site and discuss the treatment plan more than 20 times.
"When the maximum water inrush in the shaft is more than 300 cubic meters per hour, the bottom of the well is more than 700 meters deep, and the water pressure is equivalent to the bottom of the sea at a depth of 700 meters."
Si Jingzhao said, "If you don't pump and drain in time, you will flood the well 10 meters in 1 hour. We spend almost 85% of the time on water control and 15% of the time on digging."
In order to overcome the geological problems such as the vertical joint development of the surrounding rock of No. 1 shaft, mud inrush, water-rich granite and other geological problems, the tunnel construction uses a system of water control measures combining "exploration, injection, and excavation" to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of shaft No. 1 has formed a mechanized assembly line such as an excavation system, ballast system, suspension system, winch lifting system, etc., which has realized the whole process of mechanized operations such as drilling, blasting, ballast, template installation, and concrete pouring, which has accelerated the construction progress.
In the end, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 762.59 meters.
The Darui Railway has a total length of 330 kilometers and is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Channel. It is an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "Belt and Road" construction.
After it is completed and opened to traffic, the travel time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours to 2 hours on the current highway, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and play a role in promoting economic and trade cooperation and friendly exchanges between China and South Asian and Southeast Asian countries.

After returning to the motherland, Hong Kong has been closely linked with the mainland, making progress together and sharing fruitful results.
I believe that under the premise of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong can continue to play its advantages in the future, seize the opportunities of the "Belt and Road" and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and seek a better future for Hong Kong.
She also said that in the past few months, there have been constant social disputes in Hong Kong, every Hong Kong person has been affected, and journalists have also faced different challenges.
At this critical moment, I hope that friends in the press will continue to face difficulties, uphold professionalism, make fair and balanced news reports for the society, and contribute to the future of Hong Kong and the society's return to rational communication and dialogue.
Jiang Zaizhong pointed out in his speech that the glorious course that New China has traveled is also the course of development, common progress, blood connection, honor and shame between Hong Kong and the motherland.
Especially since Hong Kong returned to the motherland, the central government has unswervingly implemented the policies of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people govern Hong Kong", and a high degree of autonomy. Hong Kong and the mainland have worked together to help each other and jointly created a miracle of mutual benefit and economic take-off.
To this end, the Hong Kong press gathered together to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
He said that in the past three months, there have been a series of violent activities that violated the law and destabilized society indiscriminately. Some media published distorted and false reports, which contributed to the violence.
He called on the media to stir up the flames and create a good atmosphere for the whole people to resist violence and maintain the rule of law.
Professional media people must abide by the professional norms of journalism, use real reports and responsible speech to guide citizens to consciously and violently cut off, and maintain the justice and majesty of the law.
About 500 people from all walks of life, including the Hong Kong press, attended the reception and toasted with the officiating guests to bless the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

British tourist's car key fell into the lake and the whole family was trapped in France for five days
Recently, a couple in Wales, England, took two children to France for a holiday. As a result, they accidentally dropped the car key into the lake. The whole family was forced to wait five days before they got the new key prepared by the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with their children.
According to reports, on September 16, local time, when the British family visited a lake in France, her daughter accidentally knocked over a leather bag and the car key inside fell into the lake.
But they spent several hours and failed to find the key.
And all their belongings and cash are locked in the car.

The person in charge of the company said that the food permit can also be obtained on the spot, and it has also adopted a "tolerance acceptance" method, that is, allowing the company to submit some materials within the time limit specified in the notification commitment, "effectively feeling the convenience of reform."
The Shanghai market supervision department said that the implementation of the notification commitment system for food production permits is the first nationwide pilot.

"Eleventh" long holiday consumption survey: choose more diversified tourism to occupy the first place.
The National Day holiday is approaching, and people's holiday plans are gradually being finalized.
A reporter from the Securities Daily recently launched a small survey on the "Eleventh" holiday arrangement in the circle of friends. The nearly 20 feedbacks received show that although everyone's plans are different, "tourism + consumption" has become the key word for the "Eleventh" holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback obtained by the reporter of the Securities Daily, more than half of the people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said, "During the" Eleventh "period, I plan to take my family to Shanghai to play. Disney is the first stop, and then go to the surrounding cities to go around". Ms. Li's family in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, my country. "A family of three set off on September 28 and planned to travel around the island for ten days". The destination is Singapore; Mr. Zhang's family in Hebei chose to travel far away, he said "the daughter is less than two years old, It is not convenient to go far, plan to drive to Shandong by yourself, and play for a few days at the beach."
Tongcheng Yilong and Tongcheng Tourism recently released the "2019 National Day Golden Week Resident Travel and Travel Trend Report", which shows that the consumption upgrade trend of this year's National Day Golden Week travel and travel in the three subareas of travel, residence and travel is obvious.
The penetration rate of aircraft and high-speed rail travel has steadily increased, and the demand for star hotels and personalized non-standard accommodation has increased.
On September 23, the "2019 National Day Tourism Consumption Trend Report" released by Meituan showed that tourism consumption continued to be strong and showed a diversified upgrade of "eating, living and playing."
More young people travel in favor of high-quality and distinctive experiences, and cultural tourism and night tourism continue to soar.
In addition to tourism, various types of consumer demand are also released intensively during the "Eleventh" period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the "Securities Daily" reporter, "The main plan for this year's" Eleventh "is to buy a car."
A staff member of a Beijing auto brand 4S store told a reporter from the Securities Daily that, generally speaking, September and October each year are called the golden period of car sales.
During the "Eleventh" period, the store will launch many activities, such as lottery draws, shop reductions, etc.
In addition, many brands have recently launched new models, and it is expected that the effect of new products on sales will be more obvious.
Under the trend of consumption upgrade, people pay more attention to the satisfaction of spiritual needs, and the proportion of consumption of services such as culture and education continues to increase.
Ms. Du, who lives in Beijing, said, "Since the birth of a child, cultural and educational consumption has become the mainstay of household consumption expenditure.
This year's "Eleventh" line is full, going to the "punch card" planetarium, children's theater, about a few family weekends to go to the Elk Museum to set up tent camping, and also arranged some trial listening experience lessons. "
Some insiders said that in theory, the evolution path of residents' consumption upgrade is from survival-oriented consumption to development-oriented consumption and enjoyment-oriented consumption. Among them, a considerable part of enjoyment-oriented consumption is in the category of service consumption.
With the continuous development of my country's economy and society and the rising income level of residents, people are paying more and more attention to the spiritual level of consumer demand. Tourism and travel are a good way.
In particular, catching up with the "Eleventh" National Day holiday, the time is more ample, and people are more willing to travel and consume, which can not only meet the spiritual level of consumer demand, but also reflect the consumption upgrade of residents.
I was lonely in the afternoon, and I didn't want to go out. I hadn't adjusted the state of the children's absence.
Keep your spirits up and say to your dog Nana: Mom takes you out.
After carefully writing a few things to do when going out, the personality characteristics of type A blood are getting stronger and stronger, and I feel very awkward.
Take a suit, buy nutritional tablets, pay, buy sashimi, nana snacks.
The above is the reason to go out.
On the phone, I just told my sister Ai Jing thanks to Nana, otherwise I wouldn't even have the excuse to buy small snacks.
There was a casual smile over there, saying that the child hung up when he called.
Nana jumped into the assistant's seat in a light car and fell down honestly. She knew she was motion sick, anxious, and unwilling to accompany me.
Husband Boao rarely returned early.
I repeatedly praised the delicious salad of salmon and avocado, and went to the bedroom to watch TV in bed.
A glance at the wall of the wall, just 7 o'clock, the country of sunrise is also early sunset, and the sky is already dark.
The circle of friends is inventing the month, it turns out that today is actually the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Washed a bunch of grapes sent by friends, left half to Boao, and left the rest in the favorite flower bowl, and went out to see the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I eat grapes and she eats skin, and then I spit the seeds of the grapes far away.
The moon is hiding in the clouds. Fortunately, the clouds are walking, and the moon flickered and flickered, and it was a little dazzling.
All kinds of poems about the moon are surging in my mind, but I only like this sentence clearly: every three or five reunions / full of light protection jade hurdles / round in the sky only to hold out / the world's ten thousand surnames look up.
Maybe we have given too much emotion to the moonlight. For me now, in fact, the sentence of God's return to God, Caesar's return to Caesar is the best.
Moonlight returns to the moonlight, emotions belong to you.
After eating the grapes, this cold moon is chilling.
The Nana regiment had a slight snoring sound at their feet, stood up, and laid Nana's small blanket beside her small house. Nana lay happily on it.
Open the door and shout: Has the bath water burned?
The moon can not be seen from the bathroom window, only the moonlight can be felt, turn off the bathroom lights, and pull open the glass in an uproar.
I didn't eat moon cakes and didn't drink alcohol.

Has MCA entered the Johor Tanjung Biai National Assembly by-election?
MCA President Datuk Seri Wei Jiaxiang: "Deliver to the BN Supreme Council for discussion!"
The Tanjung Biai National By-election is imminent, and whether MCA of the BN member party will enter the traditional national seat attracts attention.
However, after the MCA Central Committee held a meeting, it was announced that it would be handed over to the BN Supreme Council to decide whether this MCA traditional seat would continue to be handed over to MCA or to be replaced by other member parties.
After presiding over the MCA Central Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon, Wei Jiaxiang told the media that any by-election will be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs), that is, it will only be finalized after a meeting of the BN Supreme Council.
He said that since the Election Committee will only meet next Monday (1st) to finalize the Tanjung Biai National By-election, the BN Supreme Council meeting is expected to be held in early October.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with BN Chairman Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahi. We all agreed that we must regain this seat from the Hope Alliance."
"We have finalized the convening of a special BN leader meeting in early October, and the leaders of the three BN parties will determine which member party will enter the battle."
Asked whether MCA would insist on the traditional seat of the BN Supreme Council, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that as the MCA president, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures, so any decision must achieve BN consensus.
"In any by-election, some people are willing to go out, and there are political parties and some parties think they should come out. This is a common thing."
"The most important thing is what organization and political alliance are we from?"
"This is a big test for us to form a political alliance for many years. We believe that BN has come all the way and upholds some valuable values."
"In the process, some people may say something, that's not surprising."
"However, once the BN Supreme Council makes a decision, everyone must prepare for the battle, that is the most valuable."
In any case, Wei Jiaxiang said that MCA will go all out to prepare for the upcoming Tanjung Biai National By-election at three levels, namely the district meeting, the State Joint Committee and the Central Committee.
"The conference will be led by Datuk Seri Huang Risheng, chairman of the (Tanjung Biai) conference; the State Joint Committee will be led by Datuk Lin Peixing, acting chairman of the Johor Joint Committee; and the Central Committee will be the acting president Datuk Ma Hanshun and General Secretary Datuk Zhang Shengwen personally deployed."
Last Saturday (21st), Indigenous Solidarity Party Tanjung Biai MP Datuk Mohammad Farri died of heart problems at the Pontian Government Hospital at the age of 42.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei, was ordered to "voluntarily patrol the mountains" for hunting wild animals
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei, was sentenced for hunting wild animals, and was ordered to compensate 15420 yuan (RMB, the same below) for the repair of ecological resources and environmental damage.
Due to the poverty of the defendant's family, the procuratorial organ enabled alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration costs, and achieved an organic unification of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy inspector general of Baokang County Procuratorate, introduced on the 27th that through three months of "voluntary mountain patrol" and other alternative labor, the defendant Zhou had established a deep relationship with the wild macaque and was deeply blamed for the previous animal hunting behavior.
On June 21 this year, the Baokang County Procuratorate filed a criminal incidental civil public welfare lawsuit in the field of ecological resources, which was publicly heard in the county court and pronounced in court.
The defendant Zhou was sentenced to 3 years in prison, 4 years of probation, and a fine of 3,000 yuan. At the same time, he was ordered to compensate 15420 yuan for the repair of ecological resources and environmental damage.
After investigation, Zhou began to set up a power grid at the cliff in late January 2014, hunting more than 20 wild animals successively, including impala, small deer, and tufted deer.
The impala is a national second-level endangered wild animal, and the small deer and tufted deer are listed in the "National Land Wildlife Conservation List."
During the court trial, Zhou confessed to his illegal facts and actions and was willing to bear incidental civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic situation in Zhou's home, under the coordination of Baokang County Procuratorate, the local village committee, forest station, and Zhou Mou reached an alternative labor compensation ecological restoration fee agreement: that Zhou Mou through the village macaque protection area Macaque domestication and management work, voluntary mountain patrol, forest protection for one year, provide public welfare services to offset the cost of ecological restoration.
Regarding the prosecutor's proposal, the court acknowledged that while agreeing to Zhou's probation, he actively fulfilled the obligation of "alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration costs."
At present, Zhou has been working in the macaque reserve for 3 months, patrolling the mountains actively and performing well.
In recent years, the Baokang County Procuratorate has integrated the procuratorial function and social governance behavior in practice, scientifically used supervision methods such as procuratorial advice, investigation supervision, and litigation supervision, and used judicial means to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment.
UN awards "Earth Guardian Award" to "Ant Forest"
In the warm applause and magnificent music, Xu Di, the project leader of "Ant Forest", and user representative Shen Junliang walked onto the podium and took over the trophy of the 2019 United Nations "Earth Guardian Award" from the host.
The 2019 "Earth Guardian Award" award ceremony was held on the 26th in New York, USA. The "Ant Forest" project that used mobile phone small programs to drive hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental protection actions won the "Incentive and Action Award" award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced the list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the people who participated in the award ceremony that day were still unable to hide their excitement.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program, Inge An Nuosheng, said, "Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to act to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that every individual can participate in actions to protect the earth, which will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" was launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Financial Services for short) on the Alipay platform in August 2016. Users record low-carbon actions such as green travel in their daily lives and online payment of water and electricity bills in the "Ant Forest" to accumulate "green energy" and "plant trees" in mobile phones.
Every time a user develops a virtual tree, "Ant Forest" and public welfare partners will plant a real tree in a desertified area.
As of August this year, 500 million "ant forest" users had accumulatively reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
In the "Earth Guardian Award" awarded on the same day, Costa Rica won the award for national environmental protection efforts. Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who came to receive the award, praised the contribution of "Ant Forest" at the scene, "It can inspire so many people to participate in green actions, which is impressive."
Jing Xiandong, chairman and CEO of Ant Financial, said that the "Earth Guardian Award" is an affirmation of the "Ant Forest" project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life. This honor belongs to all participants.
Jing Xiandong said that the "ant forest" has affected 500 million people in the past three years, and the goal of the "ant forest" in the next three years is to drive 1 billion people worldwide to participate in low-carbon actions.
While preventing desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income come from green mountains and water.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through tree planting, it also hopes to help farmers achieve income growth through agricultural product development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The public welfare and environmental protection model based on digital technology created by "Ant Forest" has also successfully gone to sea and has been used by other countries for reference.
In June this year, the Philippines' largest "e-wallet" GCash launched the Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
According to reports, GCash will work with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental public welfare organizations to plan to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the project's launch.
The "Earth Guardian Award" is the highest award in the field of environmental protection of the United Nations and is awarded once a year.
"Ant Forest" won the award, which is the third consecutive year that a green innovation project from China won the "Incentive and Action Award" award after the builder of the Saihanba Forest Farm in China and the "Thousand Village Demonstration and Ten Thousand Village Renovation" project in Zhejiang Province, China.
Economic and trade frictions affect the US economic "transcript."
The US economic "transcript" in the second quarter of this year showed that due to the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, the growth rate of the US gross domestic product (GDP) slowed down significantly from the previous quarter.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it brought were the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on the 26th shows that the US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2% in the second quarter, which is the same as the previously revised data, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
The data shows that consumption growth has become the main factor supporting US economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70% of the total US economy, increased 4.6% quarter-on-quarter, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumer spending and investment drove economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell by 6.3% in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging the economic growth by 1.16 percentage points in the quarter; exports fell by 5.7% from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged the economic growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of the US-based Ironside Macroeconomic Consulting Company, said that not only did private sector investment fail to maintain the momentum of last year's growth, but there was a significant decline, because economic and trade frictions and rising uncertainty hit corporate confidence.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, US corporate capital expenditures are expected to remain in a downward trend next year.
Analysts believe that although consumption growth has formed a strong support for the US economy in the second quarter, there are more and more signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the US consumer outlook.
Richard Curtin, the head of the survey and a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said recently that in a recent survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the US economy, which is a new high in a year and a half.
Regarding the future trend of the US economy, analysts generally believe that the US economy will continue to slow down.
However, some experts said that if economic and trade frictions are alleviated, the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
British economist think tank global economist Karin Burch predicts that in the future, the US economy will continue the gradual downward trend this year, and the growth rate will drop to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, predicts that, assuming that economic and trade frictions will not continue to escalate, the US economic growth rate this year will be 2.3%, and it will further slow down to 1.6% next year.
Ellen Hatzen, investment manager of Putnam Investment Company, pointed out that the biggest concern of enterprises at present is economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring. If economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is now.
Matt Melley, a stock strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that economic and trade friction is still the "primary problem" and the main reason for the large fluctuations in the US capital market this year. Whether the economic and trade friction can be properly resolved will affect this year. The key to the direction of US capital markets in the remaining time.
Ningxia's first couples' joint parental leave for parents of children aged 0 to 3 can take 10 days a year
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is a manifestation of respect and protection of human rights and an important symbol of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th NPC of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the "Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Women's Rights and Interests Protection Regulations" was passed by a high vote.
This is the first local regulation formulated and promulgated by Ningxia at the provincial level to comprehensively safeguard women's legal rights and interests, and will be officially implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the "Regulations" adopted this time were revised on the basis of the "Ningxia Measures for the Implementation of the" Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests "in 2007, divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles, including general rules, political rights, cultural education Rights and interests, labor and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marriage and family rights, legal responsibilities, supplementary provisions.
In the "Regulations", Ningxia encourages the exploration and implementation of joint parental leave, which is the first in the country.
In April this year, the "Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Infants and Young Children under 3 Years Old" promulgated by the General Office of the State Council has relevant descriptions for couples to raise children together.
In the process of revising the "Regulations", Ningxia innovatively proposed "to encourage employers to give couples who have children in compliance with laws and regulations to give them ten days of joint parental leave each year from the time their children are zero to three years old."
At the same time, the Regulations highlight anti-sexual harassment and protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in China's current Civil Code Personality Rights Code, and details the elements of sexual harassment, the main body and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment, etc.
Article 44 of the Regulations explicitly prohibits frequent sexual assaults against girls, and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, which has become a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Regarding women's right to know and dispose of common property in marriage and family, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know about common property and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects, and provides solid institutional support for women's rights protection.
In addition, in response to social hot issues-sex discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest practical experience of joint interviews to enhance the punishment of sex discrimination violations and more effectively safeguard women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women's Federation Joint Public Prosecution Law Department, Civil Affairs and other departments have promoted and introduced social professional forces to participate in the mediation of marriage and family conflicts and anti-domestic violence, and the results have been very significant.
The "Regulations" summarizes and improves this. Several laws encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia Xing'an League Academician Yuan Longping's Workstation Tolerant Salt-Alkali Rice Rice Harvest Rice Breaks Thousand jin
The reporter learned from the Xing'an League Administrative Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the 27th that good news was received from the "Congress on the Field Test and Acceptance of Salt-Alkali Tolerant Rice of the Academician Workstation of Yuan Longping of Xing'an League" held recently by Mengli. The average yield per mu of salt-tolerant rice exceeded 1,000 jin.
A production measurement expert group composed of 6 experts from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University, and Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs sampled and harvested the "Xingyan Series" rice on site.
After expert evaluation, on land with a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salinity content of 5‰ to 6‰, the average yield of salt-tolerant rice reached 508.8 kg.
Wang Shigang, Executive Director of Academician Yuan Longping's Workstation in Xing'an League, said: "Our next step is to innovate and reform on the basis of this year's experiment, and cultivate and optimize salt-tolerant rice varieties again to improve quality and yield."
Lai Yongcai, leader of the expert group on production testing and vice president and researcher of the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said: "Under the premise of unchanged production factors, I think that by continuously strengthening scientific and technological research, saline-alkali-tolerant rice will continue to produce miracles on saline-alkali land."
Xing'an League belongs to a contiguous and extremely difficult area in the southern foothills of Daxing'an Mountains.
In October 2018, Academician Yuan Longping's workstation was unveiled in Xing'an League.
Academician Yuan Longping led a team of experts to speed up the introduction and promotion of the newly cultivated "saline-alkali-tolerant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, build a 960-mu saline-alkali-tolerant rice base in Horqin Youyizhongqi, and use the technology route of side-by-side demonstration and promotion to promote the local poor population to increase production and income, get rid of poverty and become rich.
The on-site production of saline-alkali-tolerant rice not only injects hope into the promotion of saline-alkali low- and medium-yield fields in Xing'an League, but also provides a scientific basis for rice cultivation in saline-alkali land under the same conditions in my country.
According to the Australian website, after a marathon debate and several weeks of protests, on September 26 local time, Australia's NSW passed the Abortion Legalization Act.
It is reported that the bill has triggered political debate in the past 8 weeks. Since independent MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill, there have been serious differences within the Australian Liberal Party.
According to reports, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the ANZ Senate passed the Abortion Legalization Act by 26 votes to 14 on the evening of the 25th, making it the third longest bill to be considered by the NSW Senate.
On the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the NSW House of Representatives, NSW abortion was legalized.

Earlier, NSW Governor Berry Ji Kelian had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill. Berry Ji Kelian had intervened many times to gain more time for debate on the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.
Berry Ji Kelian defended his absentee vote: "I need to spend time managing the entire NSW."
It is reported that the Australian Liberal MP Davis was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill. He once threatened to withdraw from the NSW government because of the bill, saying that the bill caused a "government crisis."
But then, Davis made a concession.
Davis said: "The content of the amendment to the Abortion Legalization Act submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th actually provides more protection for women and doctors."
At the same time, Australia's NSW National Party leader Barilaro said he was proud to be a member of the government that legalized abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic for NSW. It legalizes abortion. Abortion is no longer a criminal act, and it does not treat aborted women as criminals."

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned assets to enrich the social security fund.
Minister of Finance Liu Kun said on the 27th that as of now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 860.1 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the deployment meeting of the national transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund jointly held by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission on the same day.
"Transferring part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system. It is a full manifestation of the development achievements of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system. It is a current and long-term perspective. Policy measures."
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of the State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund", which requires the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilots.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work of the transfer has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 860.1 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions where the Ministry of Finance fulfills the responsibilities of investors has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises already has a certain scale.
At the local level, the preliminary work of enterprise transfer has been carried out one after another.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces was basically completed, transferring state-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out preliminary preparations for the transfer, which laid the foundation for the next step of the transfer.
According to the notice issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission recently, the transfer of part of the state-owned capital from the central and local governments to enrich the social security fund will be fully launched in 2019 and will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on that day made specific arrangements for the comprehensive launch of the transfer work.
The meeting emphasized that the transfer should be done pragmatically and efficiently.
"According to the schedule, the transfer work should be basically completed by the end of 2020.
Working hours are tight and tasks are heavy. "
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and carefully arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required; solidly advance the work and accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
The transfer of state-owned assets to enrich the social security fund-starting from the starting point of "enriching the social security fund money bag", the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical displacement" of equity, but a "mathematical addition."
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the "Notice on the Comprehensive Promotion of the Transfer of Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund", which clarifies the timetable for the transfer of state-owned capital from the central and local governments to enrich the social security fund will be fully launched in 2019.
After the document was published, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented it quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of the shares held by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China to the Social Security Fund, and the total value of the two equity transfers exceeded 115 billion yuan.
According to regulations, the undertaking entities such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, enjoy the right to income, disposal and information that are classified as state-owned equity.
ICBC and ABC said in the announcement that this change in equity will not cause changes to the bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the author believes that a similar transfer of state-owned enterprises' equity is not a simple change in equity ownership, but an "addition operation" that can inspire a series of effects.
The first step in the transfer of some state-owned assets to social security, the "addition result", naturally reflects the ownership of state-owned enterprises and the sharing of development achievements by all.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in my country's economy, and their overall profitability is relatively strong and stable.
Among them, leading enterprises continue to achieve better, bigger and stronger.
On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to fully promote the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately stated that it will work with relevant departments to fully promote the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund in accordance with the deployment of the State Council Executive Meeting, fully embodying the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system and the development achievements of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the transfer, the "addition result", is to enhance the sustainability of my country's social security fund and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, my country's social security funds are under pressure, and most of the state-owned assets that have been transferred this time have the ability to continue to make profits and pay dividends. They can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide a source of water for the social security fund.
Some estimates show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the contribution rate of basic old-age insurance for enterprises can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, the "addition result", is to add a stabilizer to the capital market.
The method of transferring the main body of the undertaking to obtain the income is "dividend-based, operation supplemented."
As a financial investor in state-owned capital, the Social Security Fund does earn equity dividends.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, social security funds have strong capital operation capabilities.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, which will help improve the level of corporate operations and have a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
At the same time, as an investment vane, the increase in the shareholding weight of social security funds is conducive to further enhancing its influence in the market and playing a role as a "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, and guide investors to rational investment and value investment.

Baidu's first batch of self-driving taxi teams start trial operation
Yesterday, Baidu announced in Changsha that the trial operation of the self-driving taxi team Robotaxi has officially started.
The first batch of 45 Apollo and FAW Red Flag jointly developed the "Red Flag EV" Robotaxi fleet in the Changsha part of the open test section to start trial operation.
From now on, ordinary Changsha citizens can log in to Apollo's official website to apply to become a seed user, and have the opportunity to try the ride experience.
An experienced passenger said that he sat in the back row of the vehicle, clicked on the screen in front of the passenger's seat, and started the vehicle's autonomous driving journey with one click.
In the car, for the safety of passengers and the requirements of current policies and regulations, the trial operation vehicle is equipped with a safety officer in the driving seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
During the driving process, the vehicle can intelligently change lanes according to the road conditions, and can also judge the driving conditions of surrounding vehicles, and automatically evade situations such as overtaking at close range.
Throughout the experience, the passenger area screen displays pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind area road conditions in real time.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, you can see information such as changes in traffic lights and waiting time in advance. All vehicle conditions and road conditions are clear at a glance.
Unmanned driving has heard on TV before and thought it was far away from us, but today it feels amazing to find it in our lives.
We look forward to it going into the lives of ordinary people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 manned test licenses issued by the Changsha Municipal Government.
At present, Changsha's autonomous driving test is open to roads, passing through Changsha's artificial intelligence technology city, Meixi Lake, Yanghu Lake, Dawangshan, high-tech zone and other areas, with a total length of 135 kilometers and a demonstration area of 70 square kilometers. It is currently China's longest road mileage and largest area, covering the most complex scenes and the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration area of road collaborative infrastructure.
It is expected that by the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi fleet's trial operation roads in Changsha will cover about 50 kilometers, and plans to cover the 135 kilometers of roads currently open in Changsha in the first half of 2020.

The white paper says that as China's overall national strength and international influence increase rapidly, some people in the world worry that China will follow the path of "national power must be hegemony", and some people have put forward the so-called "China threat theory."
This has both cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances caused by the decline of power, and deliberate distortions to safeguard one's vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national revitalization, and people's happiness are both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of the people of all countries.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge."
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth. China is the largest contributor to world economic growth. China's technological innovation injects new kinetic energy into world economic growth. In the future, the role of China's economic stabilizer and power source will become more prominent.
The current world economic growth momentum is insufficient, and a stable Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development. New industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization are accelerating, the economic structure is deeply adjusted, industrial optimization continues to upgrade, and new economic growth points continue to emerge.
"The McKinsey Global Institute's research report believes that by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world's economies is expected to create an economic value of 22 trillion to 37 trillion US dollars, equivalent to 15% -26% of the total global economy. Strengthening cooperation between other economies and China will create huge economic value."
The white paper emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China, which has a more stable economic operation, higher growth quality, and promising growth prospects, is a long-term good for the development of the world economy.
Seeing China's economic development as a "threat" and "challenge", trying to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, and value chain, and "decoupling" China from the world economy is neither feasible nor harmful.
The white paper points out that opening up to the outside world in an all-round way creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China Dividend."
China is unswervingly pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy to achieve greater intensity and a higher level of opening to the outside world. China has the most potential consumer market in the world. China is the most attractive investment destination, and "going out" on a larger scale benefits more countries.
"Opening should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-sided.
Mutual benefit and two-way can last long-term. "
The white paper says that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, relaxing market access, improving the business environment, and strengthening intellectual property protection. Other countries should also expand their opening up and take corresponding measures to improve their business environment.
Only when all parties act in the same direction can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, and jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, and form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods for the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality joint construction of the "Belt and Road", building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
"China's development has benefited from the international community, and it has never forgotten to give back to the international family and provide more and better public products for the international community."
In a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, Andrei Slipniov, General Manager of the Russian Export Center, said that Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation in the economic and trade field with China, further optimize the export structure, and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
Slipniov pointed out that in Russia's exports to China, the forestry, machinery manufacturing and chemical industries account for a considerable proportion. At the same time, the export of agricultural products is also very important, including oil products, meat products and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russia's exports of non-raw materials and non-energy products to China have also shown good and stable development.
Speaking of Russia's optimization of its export structure to China, Slipniov said that Russia has set a task to expand the export of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
The Russian side will next improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote the further growth of the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slipniov said that Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China, and develop cooperation with China in the fields of pharmaceuticals and aviation manufacturing.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He emphasized that Russia's products in many fields are "superior in quality and competitive in price" compared with similar products in the West.
Talking about the goal of the two countries to achieve a bilateral trade volume of 200 billion US dollars by 2024, Slipniov said that agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving this goal.
Russia intends to promote the diversification of supply in these areas and promote the export of deep-processed products.
He emphasized that Russia intends to promote its exporters to enter the global value-added chain, of which China is one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, and chemicals are fully capable of participating in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises, "establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures, and jointly develop exports to third countries."
Slipniov said that the Russian Export Center is taking various measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank to support the export of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments, promote Russian goods to enter the Chinese market more conveniently, and develop new types of export products to China.

Demonstration shouts the president's resignation, Egyptian mountains and rain are coming, the authorities show strong suppression
Twitter hashtags and social media are vigorously advocating that the Egyptian people take to the streets today and peacefully appeal to President Sisi to step down.
But the authorities have indicated that they intend to use force to suppress it.
Since the then military chief Sisi launched a military coup in 2013 to seize power, such objections have almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest will be even more dangerous.
The British "Guardian" reported that Cairo's non-governmental organization, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, pointed out that more than 1,900 people have been arrested since protests demanding Sisi's resignation broke out last weekend.
Corruption allegations surrounding Sisi and his family squandering public money in pursuit of vanity have led thousands of people to take to the streets to demonstrate on the 20th.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior stated firmly yesterday that it will resolutely confront any attempt to destabilize the country and will not be soft-hearted.
The center of Cairo is already heavily guarded. In 2011, riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes police were everywhere on the streets around Tahrir Square, the tipping point of the Egyptian revolution.
Al Jazeera reported that the security forces detained several important scholars and social virtues on the 25th, including Nafa, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on the 24th: "Continuing to let Sisi's absolute rule will cause disaster, I have no doubt about this."
"It is in Egypt's interest for him to step down immediately."
Before Nafa was arrested, Hosni, who served as a spokesman for the former Egyptian military chief of staff An Nan, was detained.
An Nan was arrested after trying to compete with Sisi for the presidency last year.
Constitution Party Chairman Davud was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that at the moment when the economic difficulties of the poor and the middle class are intensifying, the practice of sweeping dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of the government.
Ayman Nour, the leader of the opposition and once competing for the presidency, said: "The catching action highlights the regime's indifference to the Egyptian people and how fearful it is."
"Because the economy has been messed up by him, coupled with widespread political oppression, Sisi tried to send a clear message to important generals and politicians who might replace him."
Noel pointed out that under the premise that the social and economic situation continues to deteriorate, the government's high-pressure approach will only increase the anger of the people.
Now that the barrier of fear has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, was an Egyptian military construction contractor. He began uploading a series of videos at the beginning of the month, admitting to benefiting from government corruption and detonating a small-scale demonstration in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company's general contracting of Amrak does not have to go through a statutory bidding process to obtain a lucrative contract, emphasizing that the military and Sisi's relatives, including the first lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi, are corrupt.
He deeply regretted that he had participated in it.
Ali claimed that the magnificent palaces and luxury hotels he helped Sisi Gai were in stark contrast to the extreme poverty of the Egyptians, and that the other party had not yet paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Come up and you are not alone", "Sisi you are done", "Sisi get off", "Next Friday" and so on have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets. The content calls on the people to take to the streets in a peaceful manner and asks Sisi to step down.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarwick has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Sisi is destined to be done... he is done, and those who support him are going to make a big mistake now."

Exercise is tiring and brain exhausting?
According to the Russian Satellite Network, a study of athletes showed that after high-intensity exercise, the brain will also show signs of fatigue.
The study led by Marseilles Persigrion, an expert at the French Petit-Salpetril Hospital, shows that there is an insignificant connection between mental and physical work: both require cognitive control of activities.
Persigrion explained: "You need to control an autonomous process that can force yourself to stop when you have muscle and joint pain."
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Physical Education (INSEP).
The school's experts are responsible for guiding athletes to prepare for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, that is, uncontrollable fatigue after high-load exercise, the body can not recover, and the performance declines.
INSEP asks a question: Will part of the cause of this condition be nerve fatigue, the kind of nerve fatigue caused by excessive brain work?
The research report was published in the journal Contemporary Biology.

Let Chinese citizens "go out" more at ease-Interview with Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
No matter where you go, the motherland is behind you.
On the 25th, the first consular protection video of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was launched. The sentence at the end of the video resonated with the majority of netizens.
Cui Aimin, director of the consular department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the short film aims to further make the people feel the feelings and temperature of "diplomacy for the people" and let Chinese citizens feel that no matter where they are in the world, Chinese diplomats will lend a helping hand to them, giving help, strength and hope.
There is no trivial matter overseas, and the leaves and leaves are always in love.
Cui Aimin said that in the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens "going out" has increased dramatically, from "less than one million a year" before the reform and opening up to more than 100 million person-times per year. At the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens traveling overseas is more guaranteed, and the target of consular protection and assistance has also expanded from overseas Chinese to various groups such as overseas Chinese, tourists, international students, and migrant workers.
According to statistics, since the 18th National Congress of the Party, we have organized and implemented more than 10 major operations to evacuate or transfer overseas Chinese citizens, safely evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
Accepted and coordinated the handling of about 500,000 cases of various types of assistance, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
At a dangerous time, the motherland can take you home; wanting to come to a "travel as you go" is no longer a dream.
According to Cui Aimin, as of the end of August this year, China has concluded mutual visa exemption agreements covering ordinary passport personnel with 14 countries.
In addition, more and more countries unilaterally grant Chinese citizens visa-free or entry visas and other entry facilities.
42 countries and regions such as Thailand and Egypt unilaterally grant entry visas to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, and 15 countries and regions such as Indonesia unilaterally allow Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports to enter the country without visas.
In addition to visa-free and visa-on-arrival arrangements, Chinese citizens are becoming more and more convenient to apply for visas, and their procedures are becoming more and more simplified.
By the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include reaching agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel, and Argentina to issue mutual visas for tourism and business personnel for 10 years, and with the United Kingdom to issue multiple visas for each other's tourism, business, and family members for 2 years.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched the "Visa One Stop" service, and France, Italy and Singapore shortened the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, the APEC business travel card for multiple entry and convenient customs clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining five years of multiple visas for 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region, which is of great significance for business personnel, especially private enterprise personnel, to "go out."
At present, China's effective card holdings rank first among APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively discuss bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote more countries to take visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, transform the achievements of diplomatic work into measures that benefit the people and benefit the people, and continuously improve the "gold content" of Chinese passports.

We must insist on precise efforts, strengthen real reforms and practical reforms, and earnestly implement the word "reform" throughout.
It is necessary to do a good job of combining thematic education with the work of "Lide Tree Man", compacting the rectification responsibility, ensuring that the problems are not falling, and the bottom line is cleared, so as to ensure the effectiveness of the rectification.
We must adhere to both the symptoms and the root causes, improve the long-term mechanism, weave the system cage tightly, strengthen the rigid constraints of the system, ensure that all work has rules and regulations, and truly use the system to manage people and affairs.
To adhere to the above rate, leading cadres should take the lead in strengthening theoretical armed forces, take the lead in carefully reviewing rectification, take the lead in strict self-discipline at all times, play a "key minority" demonstration role, and strive to complete various tasks of subject education review rectification.
Comrades in charge of party committees of 5 colleges and universities including Hunan University and comrades in charge of relevant units directly under the province made speeches.
Two major UHV projects have been put into operation
On the 26th, the Zhundong-South Anhui ± 1100 kV UHV DC transmission project and the Sutong 1000 kV AC UHV GIL integrated pipeline corridor project were put into operation.
Both of these projects occupy the commanding heights of the current world transmission technology in their respective fields, and will greatly improve the large-scale optimization of my country's energy allocation after commissioning.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the Zhundong-South Anhui project is the world's largest transmission project with the longest transmission distance.
Its commissioning is of great significance for promoting the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensuring the power supply in East China.
GIL, that is, gas insulated metal closed transmission line.
The Sutong Pipe Gallery project has set the record of the highest voltage level and the strongest transmission capacity of the GIL project in the world, and realized the "AC double loop network" combined operation of the highest voltage level of the East China backbone power grid.
According to the State Grid Corporation, the transmission distance from Zhundong to southern Anhui is up to 3,324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of the electrical energy will be lost on the way, and the project has been researched and developed, which has greatly increased the economic transmission distance to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the project from Zhundong to southern Anhui is put into operation, it can deliver 100 million degrees of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help solve the problem of the consumption of existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the annual transmission of this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kWh, which can meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL integrated pipeline corridor project is a control project of the UHV AC ring network crossing the Yangtze River.
If you use conventional overhead lines to cross the river, you need to build two giant iron towers over 450 meters on the Yangtze River, and build an artificial island over the size of four football fields for each tower.
In this regard, State Grid boldly innovated and developed a compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology to cross the river from underwater through the tunnel, avoiding the impact on the golden waterway.
The two projects promoted a new leap in my country's electrical equipment manufacturing capabilities.
At present, the State Grid has accumulatively completed the "10 AC 11 straight" UHV project, and "4 AC 3 straight" is under construction.
Foreign Exchange Bureau: my country's foreign debt structure continues to be optimized and the stability of foreign debt is enhanced
"Overall, my country's foreign debt structure continues to be optimized, and the stability of foreign debt has increased."
Wang Chunying, spokesman and chief economist of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said on the 27th that the main indicators of my country's foreign debt are within the internationally recognized safety line, and the overall risk of foreign debt is controllable.
Wang Chunying made the above remarks when he announced the external debt data at the end of June 2019 on the day of the Foreign Exchange Bureau and answered questions from reporters.
According to data, as of the end of June 2019, my country's full-caliber (including local and foreign currency) foreign debt balance was US$ 198.0 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion or 1.3% from the end of March 2019, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of the increase in my country's full-caliber external debt was driven by the purchase of domestic RMB bonds by non-residents, and non-residents were mainly dominated by medium- and long-term investors such as the central bank.
At the end of June 2019, the share of medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points from the end of March 2019, and the share of local currency external debt rose by 1 percentage point from the end of March 2019.
Wang Chunying said that with the inclusion of RMB bonds in my country in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Composite Index in April 2019, international investors' recognition of the Chinese bond market has further increased and they continue to increase their holdings of domestic RMB bonds.
"my country's balance of payments maintains an overall balance, and the risk of foreign debt is manageable."
The reporter learned from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences on the 27th that at present, the Spodoptera frugiperda in Yunnan has been effectively prevented and controlled, without causing large-scale outbreaks and disasters, and the prevention and control work has achieved periodic results.
In January this year, Jiangcheng County, Pu'er City, Yunnan Province, first discovered Spodoptera frugiperda migrating from abroad, and subsequently confirmed the occurrence in 129 counties in Yunnan. The Spodoptera frugiperda also gradually spread from Yunnan to mainland China, posing a direct threat to China's grain production.
Spodoptera frugiperda is an important edible long-distance migratory agricultural pest native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a major migratory pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's global early warning. It has the characteristics of "international, migratory, outbreak, and devastating."
The pest harms more than 80 crops such as corn, sugar cane, sorghum, etc., and consumes a large amount of food, which can cause up to 70% of production losses.
It is difficult to prevent and control, and there are no registered pesticides to control the pest in China.
Since the Spodoptera frugiperda migrated and invaded Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences selected Chen Aidong researcher to lead the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Agricultural Cross-border Pests Collaborative Green Prevention and Control Provincial Innovation Team, went to the front line, field investigation, collected samples, and carried out technical guidance and experimental demonstration.
The Qin Aidong team has initially grasped the population characteristics of Spodoptera frugiperda in Yunnan, natural enemy insect resources, characteristics of foreign insect sources, population migration trajectories, pesticide virulence and field prevention effects.
They actively carried out research and application of green prevention and control technologies. Through the implementation of new green prevention and control technologies such as population monitoring, adult trapping, scientific medicines and agronomic measures, the prevention and control effect in the demonstration area has reached more than 90%, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and ecological environment, and providing technical guarantees for Yunnan to effectively control the outbreak of Spodoptera frugiperda and sustainable management.
At present, the Spodoptera frugiperda in Yunnan has been effectively prevented and controlled, without causing large-scale outbreaks and disasters, and the prevention and control work has achieved periodic results.
In the next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanism of population migration and invasion outbreaks, and break through the construction of biological prevention and green prevention and control technology systems.
At the same time, actively promote cross-border international cooperation and strive to establish joint key laboratories and joint monitoring sites and demonstration areas abroad to enhance the comprehensive monitoring and early warning capabilities of Spodoptera frugiperda in Yunnan.

The white paper points out that in the past 70 years, the Chinese people have worked hard to explore and forge ahead, successfully opened the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and achieved development achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.
The white paper says that China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development depends on the hard work spirit of "800 million shirts for one Boeing". Generations of people have been galloping, struggling one after another, and paying the hard work and sweat that others can not imagine; relying on the spirit of "self-reliance" The spirit of responsibility, whether it is smooth or adversity, does not export problems, does not pass on contradictions, does not go through the spirit of forced sale and plundering of other countries to develop themselves; but relies on the spirit of "exploring the spirit of colonialism", not imperialism, The old path of colonialism does not copy the development model of Western countries, but combines China's reality, sums up experiences and lessons, draws on human civilization, dares to dare to dare to try, and embarks on a path of its own.
The white paper says that China has developed in the connection and interaction with the world. China's development has injected positive energy into world peace and development. China's roads conform to China's national conditions and adapt to the requirements of the times.
China takes practical actions to maintain world peace.
In the past 70 years, China has not actively provoked any wars and conflicts, nor has it occupied an inch of land in other countries.
The white paper points out that in the past 70 years, China's development has achieved great success. The fundamental reason is that it has found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and has continued unswervingly along this path.
This is a path of establishing from the national conditions of the country, putting the interests of the people first, reforming and innovating, seeking common development in opening up, and comprehensively governing the country according to law.
China's huge size, complex national conditions, and difficult governance are rare in the world. Without centralized, unified, and strong leadership, China will move towards division and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.
The white paper says that in the past 70 years, China has overcome various risks and challenges and created one Chinese miracle after another that has attracted worldwide attention.
Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's development has achieved historic achievements and historical changes. The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up, getting rich, and becoming stronger. It is closer to the great goal of national rejuvenation than at any time in history.
China's development path will show brighter development prospects as the times progress.

Taiwan scholar's suggestion: "Uncertainty" Taiwanese businessmen need to keep up with the mainland's development of mainstream industries
The "2019 Taiwan Businessmen Innovation Business Model Forum" was held in Taipei on the 26th and 27th.
The event invited many representatives of Taiwanese businessmen and scholars to share experiences on enterprise transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
The forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Management and Management and co-organized by Qunyi Jinding Securities and the Association of Outstanding Taiwanese Businessmen.
The two-day meeting was divided into several seminars such as transformation and upgrading mode and business strategy, and more than 100 people attended the meeting.
Chen Mingzhang, president of the Taipei Institute of Management and Management, said that China (mainland China) and the United States continue to have trade frictions, and Taiwanese businessmen face "uncertain times."
He believes that Taiwanese businessmen need to keep pace with the times and keep up with the mainstream industries developed in the mainland, paying special attention to innovative products related to the fields of technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, Taiwanese businessmen valued quality, effectiveness and delivery."
Chen Mingzhang believes that it is no longer enough for Taiwanese businessmen to have the above conditions.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and pay attention to extension services and life product services.
In addition, "service value-added" is also a new field that Taiwanese businessmen can vigorously develop.
In the speech session of representatives of Taiwanese businessmen, Xu Wentang, chairman of Taiwanese businessman Yayi Electronics Co., Ltd. from Guangdong, said that Yayi Electronics had experienced operational difficulties due to a sudden drop in orders. The group started to improve its operating conditions from structural adjustment and asset activation.
It took three years for enterprises to realize revenue after taking away the traditional electrical appliances business, transforming automotive electronic equipment, and entering the smart home appliance industry.
Bai Hongzhang, general manager of Sun God (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd., suggested that if it is difficult to develop new customers, it is better to focus on the original customers to provide "one-stop" services.
The customer's replacement of suppliers is nothing more than six factors: poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery speed, low variety, and integrity issues. As long as these six points are resolved, coupled with timely modification of production lines and expansion of product categories, enterprises will become customers irreplaceable suppliers.
On the 27th, the "2019 Outstanding Taiwanese Businessmen Award" award ceremony, also hosted by the Taipei Institute of Management and Management, was held in Taipei.
According to Taiwan's "Economic Daily", Lu Zhengzhang, general manager of Golden Land Company, whose operation center is located in Shanghai, won the "Outstanding Taiwanese Businessmen and Cross-Strait Contribution Award."
The new regulations solicit opinions: social capital requires qualifications to acquire rural land management rights
Social capital requires qualifications to acquire rural land management rights
"Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights" publicly solicits opinions and plans to supervise the acquisition of land management rights through the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published a notice for public consultation on the "Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights (Revised Draft Consultation Draft)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Draft Opinion Draft"), which added to the acquisition of land for the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises Supervision of management rights and risk prevention.
The "Draft Opinion" will openly solicit opinions from the public.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, in order to implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the "three separate powers" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the "Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Management Rights in Rural Land Contracting" and formed the "Draft Opinion."
A reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily learned that there were many important amendments to the first draft of the Opinions.
The newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting clarifies the scope of land circulation, implements the concept of "three powers are separated", and sets up "land contracting management rights" and "land management rights" separately, making a clear distinction between the transfer of land contracting management rights, swaps and the transfer of land management rights (leasing, subcontracting, shareholding or other methods).
In this "Draft Opinion", in order to implement the concept of "three powers are separated", effectively respond to the main purpose of the amendment of the "Rural Land Contracting Law", and take into account the transfer of land management rights and the exchange of land contracting management rights, the transfer of parties, procedures, supervision, etc. There are major differences. The revised draft defines the scope of circulation, focusing on the circulation of land management rights, including leasing and shareholding, and revising the regulatory name from the "Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Contracting Management Rights" to "Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management."
For the transfer and exchange of land contractual management rights, separate management measures will be issued to regulate.
The "Draft Opinion" pointed out that in the context of "separation of powers", farmers only have a certain period of land management rights.
Theoretically, even if there is a bankruptcy liquidation, farmers only have the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time. Therefore, it is no longer legally necessary to stipulate that the contracted land should be returned to the original contractor, and it also conflicts with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent the risk of farmers losing their land, in practice, methods such as preferred shares, first lease and then share repurchase have been produced.
Considering that there are more mature theoretical discussions on preferred stocks in the company law, it is recommended to use them as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of losing equity.
