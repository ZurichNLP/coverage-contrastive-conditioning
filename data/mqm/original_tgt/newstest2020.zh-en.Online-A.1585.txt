The women's volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!
On the 27th, in the match against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team won two games in a row in the case of the opponent back to a city, and finally with 3:1 Rick Holland, ushered in a nine-game winning streak.
The World Cup is nearing the end of the schedule, although the defending in sight, but against Serbia, the Chinese women's volleyball team still can not be taken lightly.
In the first two games against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team's performance was as strong as ever, with 25:19, 25:16 to go down to the first two cities, until the third game, the team encountered a setback.
The Dutch women in the backward situation to strengthen the attack of the ball, the Chinese team a pass was affected, coupled with the girls attack heart, mistakes also began to increase, and finally with 21:25 by the opponent back to a city.
After the game Lang Ping also pointed out in an interview: "In the third game, because of the mistake we sent about 8 points." "
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team should not be underestimated, the Chinese women's volleyball before the game also made difficult preparations, although lost a game, but everything is still in Lang Ping's grasp, " and the strong team to win or lose the game is normal, play five games is also normal, so we said to the players to focus, " Lang Ping said.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjust the state, Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the firepower all open, a single game to get 8 points, for the team to win a great job.
So far, the 11 rounds of confrontation is now only two rounds, although the Chinese women's volleyball has touched the championship trophy, but against the Netherlands team did sound the alarm bell for the Chinese women:the more critical the moment, the more to go all out.
In the other match on the 27th, the Russian and American women's volleyball team played five games, the United States team failed to take all three points from the opponent, so that the Chinese women's volleyball team in the match against Serbia to take all three points, can advance to the first round to achieve the defending.
All kinds of things are moving towards the favorable situation of the Chinese women's volleyball.
However, although the Serbian team's six main teams are missing, but this does not mean that they will easily give three points to the Chinese team.
Judging from the current form of the points table, the Serbian team has been basically no medal, which means that they can play against the Chinese women's volleyball match "lightly on the line", put down the burden to fully impact the opponent, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win the championship, the state may be ups and downs.
In addition, the substitute Sedas are not "slaughter" lambs, previously with the Netherlands, the two sides in five games, Serbia's second team finally 3:2 reversed the Dutch full-back line-up, which can be seen the depth of its lineup.
Before the start of the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that the Dutch and Serbian teams are not good to deal with: "Osaka's game will be very difficult, we still have to continue to prepare carefully." "
Now that the horn of the defending title has been blown, the game has really entered the "white heat stage".
On the strength of the lineup, the Chinese women's volleyball team are above the opponent, but the last moment, but also to see whether the girls can play the normal level, in the arena to release themselves.

Most of the more than 100 disabled people who attended the event boarded the cruise ship for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a disabled person who rarely goes out because of his mobility problems on both feet.
He said : Today for the first time on a cruise ship , to see the waves of the Xiangjiang River up close , to feel the pulse of Changsha's development , the mood is very excited , unforgettable . "
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Work Service Center and Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provide a nuanced service for people with disabilities.
Volunteers carry them on to and from cruise ships, especially for those with severe physical disabilities.
Fukang Social Work Service Center, the relevant person in charge said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the Party and the government, changsha City' cause of the disabled has been developing and progressing continuously, more and more disabled people have become participants, contributors and enjoyers of social and economic development, caring for the disabled, caring for and supporting the cause of the disabled has gradually become the consensus of the whole society.
The Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary, the media spotlight of all the way burst sharply, so that many of the images we usually do not remember, glittering - it is them, for our shining days, silk wisp of heat, bring light source ... ...
However, if the hero walks around, it also seems ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping, dedicated to rice research, breeding good seeds all over the world, so that more than a billion people do not have the risk of hunger and frustration, the great success, this ong is usually like an old farmer who likes to head in the fields; A person, a lifetime, a pot, a lifetime only do one thing, in the deep mountains of Guizhou gnawing cold bread, and the old man in the cottage is no different; Against a messy white hair, talking about learning to the heart, like to laugh, Qin Yi, red half of the sky of the film artist, over ninety years old, but also in order to arrange the scene in the plateau every day bump six or seven hours, but also happy to dress up in the "Ghost cat" an unknown old girl ... ... ...
They, benevolent, live simple, simple and persistent, as long as immersed in the outside of the unknown and they are self-interested in the cause, it is easy to live happily, not care about the name of Lisso, rich and prosperous.
Like Jin Yong's novel, Shaolin Temple tibetan by the cabinet of the sweeping monk, although the world's martial arts, not dazzling, no joy and sorrow.
Every "sweeping monk", every pair of red heart, behind a give me who's home country to assume.
Home country to assume, not only in the shoulder of the hero, but also in the palm of hundreds of millions of people.
Once, a female high school student's words, by the netizen crazy turn, " when the hero passed by, there must always be someone sitting on the side of the road clapping ... ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be someone who sits on the side of the road clapping. "
In fact, when the hero and give the hero applause, is not contradictory.
Roadside clappers, also in the transmission of heat and light, their own is also a glowing body.
Ordinary as you like me, there are always some opportunities in life, there are some moments, there is a accumulation of time, but also in shaping the hero's appearance.
Shanghai's outstanding judge Yu Bihua, shouldering the heavy responsibility of judicial reform, but in the annual meeting to let the communication room teacher master on stage to tell his own story, a year sent and received numerous newspaper letters, from error-free, "to do a good job of simple things, is not simple", Yu Bihua led the judges to give applause to the "sweeping monk"-style old.
It's a pity between heroes, one hero applauding another.
Sweeping monks have Shaolin Temple Tibetan Pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, NanRendong has "Sky Eye", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Yichang has a pulpit ... ... Whether you can be a hero, not only rely on their own efforts, but also have a good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
For example, "China's Skyeye", now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still struggling to climb, and the novelist Liu Cixin had yet to write "The Three Body".
The most cattle "eye" at that time was the one-sided radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico , the United States , with a diameter of 350 meters , considered to be the most " incomparable " in the world .
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope, the diameter of one-tenth of the other people.
In Japan, while enjoying world-class scientific research conditions and salaries, Nan Rendong insisted on returning home, bringing back a near-crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China, to receive more messages from outer space!
China's waste to be happy ah, invest a lot of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusted Nan Rendong , and the "Sky Eye" project opened.
It took 12 years for the site to be completed, and the project was completed for another 9 years.
With the 500-meter -caliber "Skyeye" open, China has made an unprecedented, "world-unique scientific project".
Therefore, "the eyes of the sky" is great, the South Rendong people are great, there is a big, standing high-looking republic is great.
With the trust of the country, the goodwill of the people, The South Rendong side has a chance to become the soul of the soul of the people's liver and bile.
There are young talent, white-haired hero akind walk, there are people on the roadside gently clapped, such a country, very beautiful very harmonious.

Chirac's death, political legacy.
On the 26th, the former French President Jacques Chirac died suddenly, aged 86.
At a time when the world is in a century of unturned change, the French politician's many political legacies left in power are still worthy of our praise.
Mr Chirac has been French president for 12 years in a charismatic manner.
He not only inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Charles de Gaulleism, but also firmly supported European integration, and was the representative figure of the pursuit of the "European dream".
At the same time, he is also a strong advocate of multipolarity and multilateralism in the world, is a strategic vision of the politician.
That is why the French media described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's relishing political decisions was his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined forces with Germany to resist American pressure and walk in the forefront of the anti-war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terrorist activity and make the world more dangerous.
It turned out that Chirac's warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is in tatout and The unilateralism of the United States is becoming more and more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choice on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of great enlightenment significance.
Mr Chirac is also a French politician who has made Chinese familiar and kind.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of Sino-French relations, and after being first elected president of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with a strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During Chirac's reign, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and bilateral cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transportation and other fields made breakthrough progress.
The Year of Chinese-French Culture, initiated by Chirac, has created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac's lifelong love of Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
According to Chinese diplomats who are understood to be his, Chirac can carry some of Li Bai and Du Fu's poems, and even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
"Don't look at the pyramids is not really to Egypt, don't look at Qin Qi really to China" - this gold sentence comes from Chirac.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency , Chirac said : The West has concerns about China's political and social development , the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth and China's political position in the world .
But I have confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it build its ideas and values for harmonious development and to assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. "
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich it.
The Sass have gone, but the political legacy and revelations that Chirac left to the world will live on.

Hong Kong is an important trading partner and largest source of trade surplus for the United States, the statement said.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment and clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the United States passes this bill, it will, in addition to undermining the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, will make The Sino-US relations worse, without any benefit to others.
The statement said Hong Kong will, as always, unswervingly implement the "one country, two systems" policy, continue to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Basic Law and earnestly fulfill its obligations.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international trade, whether in the past, now or in the future.
The two houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week, the European Times reported Tuesday.
French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that France can not "accept everyone " , but at the same time also strive to " properly accept " .
The report said Macron was trying to find a compromise on immigration, slowing the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview during the general debate at the General Assembly in New York, Macron said he hoped there would be a "two-pronged" approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Macron said : " If France wants to accept (immigrants) properly , it cannot accept everyone , " Macron said .
Macron cites four priorities in immigration policy: granting asylum status as soon as possible to refugees in need of protection; promoting more efficient integration of migrants; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who enter France illegally and are not suitable for stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system has been the most discussed topic of all time.
Mr Macron said he wanted to "assess" the system, but not to abolish it, but to impose restrictions.
Following Macron's comments, Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Alliance, tweeted that Macron's comments were "empty talk."
The president of the Senate, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "detente" but "realistic" way, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Mr Varoual, a left-wing Socialist lawmaker, said France should "accept more and better" on immigration and criticised Mr Macron for "manipulating" the issue.
Reported that the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been enacted for a year, it has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time failed to appease the right-wing opposition.
The topic of immigration policy will again be the focus of far-right attacks in the next 2022 election, and Macron needs to do something about it, but at the same time risk angering the left within the ruling party.
The lower house of the French National Assembly is reportedto debate immigration policy from September 30, while the Senate will debate it from October 2.
There are signs that China's A-shares are ushering in a "buy-back tide", many listed companies have come up with "real money" to buy back the company's shares.

In this regard, Shanghai Mei Kerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd. Chairman Xu Yang said that this year, the overall valuation of the A-share market is low, with a relatively low price to buy back shares, is conducive to listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, but also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow, is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system, but also promote listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.

In addition, from the amount of repurchase payments, this year, there are six listed companies to buy back the amount of more than 1 billion yuan.
At the top of the list is Yili's shares, which have a buyback of more than 5 billion yuan.
What impact will listed companies' share buybacks have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, vice dean of the School of Finance and Finance at Chinese Min University, told China News Agency that the repurchase shows, on the one hand, that listed companies have strong economic strength and a better financial position, the ability to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence, on the other hand, it also shows that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, responsible for the market and responsible to investors.
The former is based on the company's good business performance, while the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have a high quality.
For capital markets, this is the most central element of the foundation.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is helpful to boost investor confidence and support the stock prices of listed companies.
According to the Oriental Securities Research Report, according to the a-share listed companies since the beginning of this year set the overall number of expected share buybacks, as well as the average share buyback transaction price calculation, this year's share buyback for the A-share market to bring incremental funds is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.

Wang Boxiang, Party Secretary of Shandong Yuan Shouguang County - Qiang County Fumin Chizi-Heart - Xinhua
Wang Boxiang, Shandong Shouguang, born in February 1943, took part in the work in 1967, has served as the township party secretary, county party secretary, mayor and other positions.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was the party secretary of Shouguang County, Shandong Province, when Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
In the five years of Shouguang's tenure, Wang Boxiang, with the heart of the people, concentrated on three things: first, to promote the industrialization of vegetables;
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, but also have the lessons of growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers grow vegetables but can not sell, rotten in the ground.
Wang Boxiang research found that the key to catch vegetables is to do a good job of circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in setting up a wholesale vegetable market, which started the development of a market economy.
Party members and cadres should take the lead, screw up, all the losses of the county bear.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhucun, started 17 winter-warm vegetable sheds, and the village emerged 17 "double million households".
Subsequently, the county set up a promotion group, in Wang Boxiang's mobilization, Wang Leyi in various townships tour guide;
For thousands of years, 1.6 million mu of land in the north of Shoubei, in addition to salt-alkali beaches, is shallow beach coating.
The local people are living very hard.
Shounan has a vegetable shed, Shoubei to do?
Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to engage in a general conference war, in the desert beach camp, a dry is forty or fifty days.
Wang Boxiang and the county's leading cadres eat and live in the construction site, with the migrant workers like cart burden, wind meal sleepover, ordinary people see them all stretch their thumbs, heart-to-heart admiration ... ... ... At that time, Shoubei developed 150,000 mu of shrimp pond, 200,000 mu of salt fields, 600,000 mu of cotton fields, in the salt-alkali beach coated to develop a "polypot."
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang first participated in the Weifang City Industrial Conference as county party secretary.
During the meeting, a "comparison table of industrial economic figures in the urban areas of the 12 counties of Weifang City" was issued, at first glance, the total industrial output value, Shouguang is good, ranking fourth.
But if the original salt is removed, Shouguang's pure industrial output value is only 119 million yuan, ranking third in the penultimate.
Wang Boxiang with more than 70 people to take the group, ran to the field "change of mind."
Back less than a year, the county invested 150 million yuan, on 77 projects.
Every year since then, the organization of the "take-up mission" to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai and other places to take the Bible.
Shouguang lack of enterprises, but also lack of entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang presided over a special meeting clapboard: in the county public selection of plant managers, 40 "career-minded people" stand out, was pushed on the industrial front line.
In 1991, Shou Guang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang City Deputy Mayor.
He left behind is more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, is 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, is 4854 enterprises, is more than 100,000 "million households", is recognized by the people of the cadre team. Shouguang people still affectionately call him "our secretary of Boxiang".
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over a meeting of foreign ministers of China and African members of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
African Current Security Council Members Ivorian Foreign Minister Tano, Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Oyono, South African Foreign Minister Pandor and Member-designate Niger Foreign Minister Carla, Tunisian Foreign Minister Jesinawi and others attended the meeting.
Wang Yi put forward four suggestions on strengthening Cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, by uniting to make strength.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, with the direct consequence that the basic norms of international relations are challenged and the role of the United Nations being undermined to the detriment of the interests of the vast majority of developing and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To meet this challenge, China and Africa need to work hand in hand, side by side, unity can be strength.
In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not only on the three votes, but on the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just by four votes, but by driving other countries to follow suit, influencing and shaping the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China and African members of the Security Council have established a "3-plus-one" coordination mechanism to make full use of it.
Second, the settlement of disputes is through consultation.
China has always advocated a political solution to hot issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as experience in the successful good offices of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex issues on the Council's agenda, particularly in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and some are directly related to external factors.
Together, we should make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation and so on.
Third, rely on self-improvement.
African countries and peoples know Africa's problems best, and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing africa's hot-button issues, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa's will, play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote capacity-building for Africa's autonomous peace operations.
Fourth, rely ingon sedidowns on development.
China and the vast number of African countries are developing countries, and we should put economic and social development first and support each other in the development path they have chosen.
China is ready to build the Belt and Road With the African Union Agenda 2063, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries enhance their development capacity and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We should work together to promote greater investment in Africa's development by the United Nations.
With the resurgence of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China has made full efforts to provide human and material assistance within its capacity, and is willing to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize the United Nations, WHO and other countries to step up their assistance and play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Trudeau 'people's set collapses', can he be re-elected
This time, Mr. Trudeau tripped out of a "big hole" that Mr. Trudeau himself dug up a little.
In recent days, Canadian media have released a series of old photos of the current prime minister, Mr. Trudeau, posing as a black man.
This was considered an apparent act of racial discrimination that caused a stir in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
Canadians, however, don't buy much.
Trudeau was stoned to his feet.
As political commentator Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-black-faced movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile critics of the opposition or dissent in the party in this regard "big loss" and repeatedly threatened that "whoever makes this mistake should be immediately expelled".
Simply put, this time it's a big hole that tripped Trudeau out of his head, and it was Mr. Trudeau himself who dug it out a little.
Mr. Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is young and handsome, and he has had a whirlwind of "political idols" when he first came out.
Originally a "political man", he took over as leader of the federal Liberal Party, and after winning an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative elections, when the Federal Liberals won a valuable single cabinet in the lower house of parliament.
At the time, Mr. Trudeau put forward a number of deafening platforms and ideas, such as "ethnicity and gender equality", "eco-environmental protection" and "economic revitalization", emphasizing the eradication of corruption and "improper winds".
However , in his five years in power , he has been in a tailspin in almost all of the above , " high and low . "
In the case of "ethnicity and gender equality", the "blackface" incident aside, after he "didn't speak up" on a series of issues related to First Nations, led first nations groups and leaders to move protest tents to the gates of Parliament Heights on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In the fight against corruption, Mr. Trudeau became embroiled in the tumultuous "Lan Wanling affair" late last year and early this year.
It was revealed that his hometown of the construction company "Lan Wanling" major violations of private fraud cases, to the department responsible for the investigation and prosecution of the department and officials pressure, the latter "high-lifting hands."
Moreover, Mr. Trudeau, after the furore, was infuriated by the official who disclosed the case, Mr. Wang, who was the first to disclose the case and who was canada's attorney-general at the time.
Although the case itself is still suspect, its suspicion is difficult to wash away.
Many observers point out that Mr. Trudeau's five years in power have collapsed mainly because of his own "pits", which are no more than "tiger-headed" "self-inflicted" and "broader than self-discipline, strict eras".
Since 2015, support for Mr. Trudeau has slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while opponents have soared from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent, according to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll.
While other opposition parties and their party chiefs have done just as well, even a significant proportion of voters who still want to vote for the federal Liberal party are now dismissive of the federal prime minister and leader of the ruling party.
On October 21st, as the new Canadian federal legislative elections begin, will Mr. Trudeau repeat the drama of his triumph five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Tianjin development integration level, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened.
Beijing News reporter from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission was informed that the capital airport has been in a super-saturated operation state, the opening of Daxing International Airport, will enhance the capital's aviation service capacity.
After Shanghai, Beijing became the second city in China to have two airports in the same city, and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, Pudong Airport is mainly similar to international shipping, the future capital airport and Daxing Airport will also serve the domestic and international different aviation business differentiation positioning, to provide a more segmented service.
Daxing Airport, from a business development point of view, for the capital airport is more favorable impact.
Capital Airport in 2018 passenger throughput exceeded 100 million passengers, ranking first in the country, but compared with the rapid growth of business needs, there is still a clear capacity difference, especially international routes demand gap.
In order to better serve the domestic and foreign passenger travel, travel and other needs, to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open, international integration of the city's development trend, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers, cargo and postal throughput of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airportpositioning does not overlap, respectively for different customer groups, but also have enough market space.
From the economic account level, Daxing International Airport's navigation, obviously will form a win-win effect, ease the tension of Beijing's air capacity, speed up the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput, to create the capital aviation dual-core operation of the incremental cake.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, the future need not all focus on the capital airport travel, can also reduce the route too concentrated brought about by a series of problems, such as longer station guarantee time, passengerboarding speed slower, indirectly increase the aircraft and passengers stranded at the airport time, increase the burden of airport operation, through the capital airport shipping burden, in fact, also improve the passenger travel experience.
According to the media to go to the large international airport a variety of transportation routes time and cost estimates, such as from the South Fifth Ring Road to beijing to open high-speed directly on Daxing Airport high-speed, driving 50 minutes can go to, oil money back and forth about 40 yuan, high-speed fee 15 yuan; Daxing Airport Line, according to the distance of 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers for the limit, the fare is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three, the public can also take the Beijing-Hongxiong intercity, from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport Station as long as 20 minutes.
In general, there are a variety of modes of transport options available to the public to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.
And from the perspective of trend development: Daxing Airport is the location of Beijing-Tianjin-Tianjin transportation hub, so the distance from Beijing is slightly far, but strengthen the radiation to Hebei, Tianjin, convenient for more people to travel, to pull Hebei, Tianjin's economic development is of great significance.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers will be able to enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
Daxing Airport's supporting transportation facilities are very perfect, in addition to the Beijing District direct to Daxing Airport's new airport line, there are a number of highways connected to Daxing Airport and the surrounding area.
Just as passengers in Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through Guangfu, Guangshen and other highways, residents of Langfang, Xiong'an New District and other places around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport, access to convenient and efficient air services.
From this, it can be seen that the navigation of Daxing International Airport, not only added several runways and several aircraft, whether from the competitive level of enterprises, consumer experience level, or from the regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Tianjin development integration level, have far-reaching and positive significance, not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, for the vast number of residents of Beijing and Tianjin to provide a variety of options, promote the further improvement of the quality of service of the Beijing shipping industry, but also conducive to the development of Beijing-Tianjin integration, To promote the economic and trade development of the surrounding area of Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for the navigation of Daxing Airport, we should not only calculate the small account of individuals in the economy, but also the overall development of the big account.

2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Forum held in Chengtian Hue Province
At the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new signs and continued to maintain growth, said Nguyen Dejian, deputy director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and views on the economic development in 2019 and the impact of some FTAs, some outstanding issues of the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnamese social culture in 2019, and projections and recommendations for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
It was widely felt that global economic growth would slow in the first few months of 2019 and that risks and challenges would increase.
Trade frictions between the major economies have further shrank global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded that despite the global economic uncertainty, with 70 percent of the world's economies stagnant, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many encouraging achievements, with stable macroeconomic performance and effective control of inflation, and the consumer price index grew by an average of 2.64 percent in the first half of 2019, the lowest growth rate in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 % in the first half of 2019 , although down from 7.05 % in the same period last year , but still at a high level compared with the level for the same period in 2011-2017 .
In predicting the trend of Vietnam's economic development in 2019-2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of Vietnam's National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting, said vietnam's economy is showing high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of world economic turmoil.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macro-economy will continue to be basically stable, the implementation of various FTAs will boost trade development, economic restructuring and business environment improvement will be further strengthened, as a result of trade frictions, Vietnam's export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, we should strengthen the monitoring and forecasting early warning mechanism, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnam's exports, look for opportunities to expand new export markets, and create facilities for the export of agricultural and aquatic products and other commodities.
At the same time, the inflation rate should be kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and eco-agriculture.

Witness the ten-year "cloud rise" of digital China in Yunji Town - Xinhua
If the 2009 local website forum as the origin, 25-27 in Hangzhou, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Conference has been a full decade.
From the concept of "in the clouds" to the practice of "up to the cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies to support China's economic development, social management and public service in 10 years.
In The Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Cell Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang Province, a new "colleague" with Alibaba Cloud Artificial Intelligence was recently filled by a quality inspector.
It is 24 hours a day, the speed of identification is more than twice the manual, quality inspection accuracy is stable at more than 95%.
According to company officials, the camera with the "quality inspector" has focused on learning more than 40,000 defective samples, with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language, there will be defective battery chips classified.
This enterprise is just one microcosm of today's cloud computing transformation that is driving manufacturing.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued the Guide to Promoting the Implementation of The Cloud for Enterprises (2018-2020) in 2018, and proposes that by 2020, the awareness and enthusiasm of enterprises on the cloud will be significantly improved, and the proportion and application depth of the upper cloud will be significantly increased.
Today, data-centric cloud computing has opened the way for a digital economy that is a key element of data, said Wang Jian, founder of Alibaba Cloud.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, China's cloud computing industry has been expanding in size.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019) released by the China Information and Communications Research Institute in July this year, the overall market size of cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2 % over 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible "cloud" has also unwittingly changed urban management and social life.
The "urban brain", which has been on display for the third year in a row, is still a cause for concern at this year's Cloud Habitat Conference.
Alibaba Cloud, the current urban brain has been from traffic management tools to urban management hub, related to cooperative applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain through powerful computing power, so that "stop first and pay later" "the number of visitors in real time awareness" "travel line design" and other new urban management services functions to achieve.
In the field of government affairs services, with "one cloud" docking "one thing", the "palm office" "hands on the work" co-promotion, cloud computing for the supply of government services to bring convenience.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform through the government affairs cloud.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, collecting data from 3,066 categories of 19.08 billion.
The average monthly call-up and sharing of data between government departments in Zhejiang province has reached 12 million times, and every time the data flows on the 'cloud', it may mean that the masses are running errands less.
Make tea with plastic tea bags with caution!
A new canadian study has found that a pack of plastic tea bags could release billions, or even tens of billions, of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated annual intake of microplastics, but so far there is no evidence that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans, the Central News Agency reported.
Researchers at Magill University in Canada have reportedly found that dipping plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) releases about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics an estimated person consumes throughout the year.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, showed researchers testing four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montevideo shops and cafes, opening them, washing them and dipped in almost boiling water for five minutes, and then analyzed them with electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study , they found that more than 11.6 billion plastic particles were released in a single tea bag , " several stages higher than the plastic load of other foods before . "
Reported that most tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many use natural fiber single brands still use plastic to seal.
Some of the branded tea bags are no longer made of paper in favour of plastic, which the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic that the researchers define as being between 100 nanometres and 5 mm in size, mainly caused by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea ditches around the world, as well as microplastics in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first found plastic particles in human stool samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea bags, the Canadian team put water fleas into contaminated water and found that microplastics affect their behavior and cause them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence so far that ingesting plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what effects they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that the large amount of plastic particles released by these tea bags may be due to their contact with boiling water, which may break down or ooze toxic substances even when "food-grade" plastics are heated above 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said a climate emergency was the biggest threat to the survival of small island states.
There, a natural disaster can erode a generation's development gains.
The hurricane-hit areas of Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas so far this year illustrate this point.
About a quarter of the population of small island developing States lives at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
Relocation can have serious implications for their social and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island nations are once again leading the world in the right direction by working together to achieve carbon-neutral and 100% renewable energy by 2030.
"The climate crisis is putting new injustices on the old ones , " Guterres said .
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
As these countries are in middle-income status, many are also trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and it is time for major decisions and substantial investment in small island developing States. "
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for help to small island developing States to manage disaster risk, invest in climate-adaptive infrastructure and ways to transition to renewable energy, and urged international agencies to help small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, access funding.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of the protection and conservation of the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
The intergovernmental panel on Climate Change's latest special report this week confirms that the oceans have suffered the "sweeping" consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may experience some extreme sea level rise that would have occurred once a century ago.
The report warns that some island States are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have taken a heavy toll.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and in the past 40 years, plastic pollution has increased tenfold.
Demand shipping, mining and tourism are leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They rely heavily on external markets, subject ingress to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also grappling with the security implications of illegal trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
"By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere, " Guterres said.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples that can be used around the world. "
He stressed that small island developing States were an exception to sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the international community as a whole.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is liquid.

"Some of the over-age migrant workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where are you looking for the young workers now?
There is no way to use so many 'old people' on the site. "
Recently, for the construction site there are many over-age migrant workers (over retirement age) phenomenon, the long-term in the construction industry as a construction contractor' Yu Kui sighed.
Recently, the author's university to carry out rain pollution diversion project, the campus appeared a lot of migrant workers, if you pay attention to observe, you will find that there are many over-age migrant workers.
Over-age migrant workers go out to work is not "idle", but because "can't be idle", with "have to be so" helplessness and hardship - whether it is saving money to solve their old-age and medical problems, or helping their children, are driving these should "free down" old people continue to work hard.
The "old-fashioned" of over-age migrant workers is not as easy as we think.
Parenting children, supporting the elderly, for children to read, help children build buildings to buy cars, help children to start a family, next generation to raise grandchildren, when these migrant workers completed the "life task", money bags have been hollowed out and even a lot of debt, most lack of wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag down the children also in order to save some wealth for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "dry to dry up."
Many "post-80s" "post-90" and even "post-00" new generation of migrant workers are not willing to engage in difficult conditions, high labor intensity of the secondary industry or low-end service industry, resulting in a structural "job shortage", these unattractive jobs, to provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of a skill, physical function and labor ability and decline, many over-age migrant workers are doing high intensity, low income, high risk, less protection of the work.
Can do a day is a day, can earn a little more, "cannot idle" behind the survival dilemma of over-age migrant workers, can not be ignored and ignored.
To solve the problem of underpayment and demand for wages, improve labor protection, reduce security risks, increase labor income, improve the survival of over-age migrant workers, in addition to their "self-rescue", but also inseparable from the public sector system protection and humane care.
Some scholars point out that over-age migrant workers are less likely to rely on home-grown land to solve their old-age care and medical problems, they must otherwise support their families.
Reading the "can't be idle" of migrant workers " helpless ness and strong, help us to better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers.
Seeing the back of the over-aged migrant workers, hearing their sighs, trying to get back to the countryside they really realize the "old-fashioned", the need for the public sector, the market and society in the benign interaction of responsibility, the need for multi-party efforts.
Chemezov said Russia will not export such a system for the next five years because "the country's military will be supplied first before export production".
This approach is fully in line with international practice.
Major producers of arms and military equipment always first ensure their defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grekhov, deputy commander of the Russian Air Force, said the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Diamond-Antai" Sky Defense Konzern.
This is a new generation of air defense systems that work to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 km.
In addition, according to some sources, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles that exceed five times the speed of sound, and even targets in near-space.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, in particular the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergey Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He says the system is in great demand in the world, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment.
According to information on 15 September, the modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the Arctic Air Defence Regiment of Sindi Island has been completed.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
The Russian Defense Ministry said it was a complete process in the transition plan to a more advanced defense tool in the northern strategic direction.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic has increased significantly, " said the Russian Northern Fleet News Service. "
Crucially, the system has been successful lying in the Arctic and the Arctic, according to military assessments.
Air defense regiment officers and soldiers have been trained in the new system and are ready to enter combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, it is still partially retained.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, whether they are targets flying at high speeds at outer altitudes or "fish in the net" close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by The Golden Diamond-Antey Sky Defense, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 km per second at a distance of 60 km.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defences in the far north to ensure the safety of its airspace on the northern sea route.
Not long ago, the first 12 Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the Arctic's air defense system.
The Russian Defense Ministry said at the time that the Arctic "Thor" forces will be expanded to a full brigade-level structure in the future.
Coupled with the new S-400 long-range systemdeployed on the New Earth Islands and the Cora Peninsula, as well as the "Pantsir-SA" short-range system deployed in the Far North, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are powerfully defending Russia's polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will have a hard time breaking through this defense.
According to the Russian government, the flagship store would be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As the operator of the Russian store, The Russian Company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Ospindo has online stores on China's largest trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), and Wechat, a multi-functional instant messaging software, with online stores, and its own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center will work with Rusto to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards, and screen virtual shelves for products.
The store plans to open by the end of this year and launch products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to the Russian Export Center, China's e-commerce platform has a total of 1 billion visits per month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, to more than $1 billion in 2018.
Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kochevnikov, the new store will display goods from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles or more.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles of sales are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods, regarding Chinese goods as high-quality and green and environmentally friendly products. "
Mr. Kochevnikov says competition for Chinese consumers, who compete for strong purchasing power, is fierce and intensifying.
" Our goal is to launch 500 companies through this store in three years , " he said . "
At the same time, the platform will also be on the Russian Far East enterprises products.
Vyacheslav Cheglov , a professor of basic departments of trade policy at The Plekhanov University of Economics in Russia , said : This is a political project that represents the image of both sides , because the Russian export center is state-owned rather than private . "
"I don't see a lot of very competitive Russian goods on the market. "
He believes the project will probably not actually be implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said during the Oriental Economic Forum that product information from more than 170 Russian companies has been released on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be purchased in China and other countries, RIA Novosti reported.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training program for experts from Taobao University for Russian companies, the first of which was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also serve as an organizer for Russian companies participating in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the 2nd China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November.
Large-scale exhibitions will be held in the 1000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also be the center of commercial project events, agreement signing ceremonies, presentations and talks with Chinese business representatives.
Some 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
"In addition to the agricultural booths , we will certainly hold business meetings , i.e. to arrange direct links between entrepreneurs , " said the Russian Export Centre's press service . "
"This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and ensure that dozens of special meetings are scheduled for them. "
In addition, the fair will host master classes, cooking contests and Russian food tastings prepared by famous Russian chefs in the "Shanghai Station for Exploring Russian Cuisine".

Xinhua Times Review: Firmly Walk our own way
The white paper "China and the World of a New Era" released on the 27th answered: In the past 70 years, the fundamental reason for The success of China's development is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct path of development with socialism with Chinese characteristics and have unswervingly followed this path.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow its own development path.
Since modern times, in the environment of accumulation of poverty and weakness, internal and external troubles, generations of benevolent people in order to explore the way to save the country and the people up and down, go forward to follow.
However , " the constitutional monarchy , the restoration of the imperial system , the parliamentary system , the multi-party system , the presidential system have all been tried and tried , and the results have not worked . " "
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist road with Chinese characteristics in practice.
This road that China has come out of is the road to the well-being of the Chinese people, the road of rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the road of common development between China and the rest of the world.
It is precisely because it is on the right path that China can do its own thing well, in order to become the world's second largest economy, the largest contribution to global economic growth, in order to continue to benefit the world through its own development.
As pointed out in the white paper, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions, to meet the requirements of the times, will be with the times to show more and more bright prospects for development.
Looking back, Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path, and look around the world, Chinese people cherish this right path more.
Chinese understand the truth of the South Orange North, understand that suitable for others do not necessarily suitable for their own, only suitable for their own is the best.
It is with this path of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a remarkable miracle.
In the tortuous process of human's advance, "The Thetheory of The End of History" was famous for some time.
Today, the success of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics has declared the end of the "end of history theory", the collapse of "China's collapse theory" and the failure of the "socialist failure theory".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve the prosperity of their people, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and reference for countries and peoples in the world who both want to accelerate their development and maintain their independence, and to follow the path that is in line with their national conditions.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose the path of development that suits their national conditions.
China does not "import" the foreign model, nor "exports" the Chinese model, but will unswervingly follow its own path, realize its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges with other countries in governance, and make due contributions to the common realization of good governance and governance.
A Foodworks supermarket boss has been slammed as "disgraceful" after it was found that he had fired a 66-year-old woman by text message because he preferred to hire staff from asian backgrounds.
The committee said the way Inwhich of Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, who has worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated employees "extremely unfairly" and may have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had been "trying to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, The Vice-Chairman of the Committee, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang has published some job advertisements at various Chinese employment forums in Australia in the past".
Of the job requirements listed in these positions, one says "Asian lady first" and the other says "Asian employee preferred".
The third post said he was "more inclined to overseas (sic).
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by text message in April, later claiming that this was due to her absence and the alleged small cash shortfall at the cash register, which ranged from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacking in evidence.
In three years she has only missed one shift, and the "missing amount" totals a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms. Ayton's dismissal "had nothing to do with her actions or performance."
" It seems to me that the real motive of the defender to dismiss Mr. Wang is that he prefers to hire employees with an Asian background , supported by the evidence of the job advertisement released by Mr. Wang , " he said .
Under section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's actions appear to constitute a violation of the Anti-Discrimination Act and/or the dismissal of the applicant is unlawful. "
Mr. Sams said it was inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton in view of his "appalling" treatment of Ms. Ayton.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker with an hourly wage of A$26.
In light of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his rulings and documents to the committee's director to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He stated that Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for firing her.
" I believe that the respondent has taken an incorrigible unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant , and Mr Wang "waits" for this opportunity , which he believes will 'justify' termination of the applicant's employment . "
"He was wrong ... The respondent completely ignored any natural and fair treatment given to her when dismissing the applicant, and it was shocking that he was disrespectful and grossly unjust. "
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business , " it must be frank that no decent employer would fire an employee in a very unfair and perfunctory manner that was acknowledged in this case . " "
" This is shameful and extremely unfair , " he said . "

From the purpose of repurchase, the company buys back shares and the majority shareholders increase the holding stake seems the same, but in the implementation of the main body, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchase, the stock itself, such as the interests and interests of a large difference.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai MeiKerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., told The Securities Daily in an interview that the "Opinion on Supporting Listed Companies to Buy Back Shares" issued in November 2018 was repaired in view of the existing system of narrow scope of share repurchases, complicated decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory systems.
In January this year, the SSE and Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially issued the Regulations on the Implementation of Share Repurchases by Listed Companies, which have broadened the sources of funds for repurchases of listed companies, appropriately simplified the implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all types of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee shareholding plans.
After the introduction of opinions, listed companies to carry out share repurchase operations, with more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is easier, share repurchase enthusiasm is also greater.
Buyback of shares in a relatively low position is also conducive to listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, improve the return on net assets, reduce the pressure on the company's earnings indicators.
Compared with the increase of large shareholders, the company buyback shares is more significant, but also reflects the listed company's active market value management will and cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervaluation of the stock price is the main factor of the repurchase of listed companies, the company's share price has not reflected the future development prospects of the company, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but can not blindly invest, need to pay attention to the financial results of such listed companies and the specific business situation.

Yili shares have paid 5,792 million yuan for share repurchase, and in the near future to adjust the use of share repurchase, from the original plan "repurchase shares will be used as a source of stock for the later implementation of equity incentive" to "cumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares for the implementation of equity incentive stakes, the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used to write off to reduce the registered capital."
Yili said the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would help further improve earnings per share and effectively improve the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group on September 25 issued a repurchase progress announcement, TCL Group has repurchased 3.59% of the company's shares, a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.

Hu Henghua, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee and secretary of the Changsha Municipal Committee, and The four leaders of the Xiangjun in the construction machinery manufacturing - Zhan Chunxin, Liang Jinggen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang, set a "small goal" around "Changsha from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing" - three or five years later to build a world-leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster.
In Changsha to build the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster, in the current fashionable words, is to create "the strongest surface."
As the capital city of inland, Changsha shouted out this rhetoric, where does the bottom of the gas come?
With the strength of the bully side leakage.
The dialogue of the four engineering machinery Xiang enterprises, each hand, covering the sky, underground, sea, land all areas: mountain and river intelligent light aircraft, the concrete transport pump of Zhonglian Heavy Branch, Sany Heavy Industries full-ground crane, iron construction heavy industry tunnel shield machine, its "hard strength" can be described as one-step world, proud group.
Once upon a time, China had little voice in the field of construction machinery manufacturing.
Time-shifting, Chinese enterprises "introduced" "going out" two-wheel drive, take the "Belt and Road" initiative of the east wind, acquisition, merger, plant and so on, a leap into the global construction machinery industry leader.
Among them, Sany Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Branch, Iron Construction Heavy Industries, Shanhe Intelligence and other leading enterprises in engineering machinery, its output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, has been significantly ahead of similar enterprises.
It's the camera that moves with the momentum.
The "Four King Kongs" of Xiangjun, the construction machinery industry is the leader of Changsha engineering machinery industry cluster, and is also the head enterprise of the global construction machinery industry.
In the global industry, who lives down, and live well, is the hard heart of the speech.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered from the cold winter, many international well-known engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen down, but Changsha's construction machinery manufacturing enterprises to "cat winter" as "winter swimming", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intellectual transformation, not only to the past, but also more strong body bone.
With the stars of the month of the government and enterprises to give the same force.
The development of advantageous industries requires both enterprises to be proactive and for the government to act actively.
Changsha has the "engineering machinery capital" reputation, lies in the convergence of the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, to create a number of related industrial clusters, and through the optimization of the business environment, improve supporting services, simplify the approval process and other management initiatives, enterprise research and development, manufacturing, sales costs greatly reduced.
Good business ecology, so that the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises come.
History has been Changsha to build the world's leading level of engineering machinery for the front, when I do not wait, when rendoun not allow.
Whether it is the government, or enterprises, and even related to the production and research and other links, should seize the opportunity, the trend up, set the goal, continue to exert efforts, in order to build a manufacturing power to contribute to Hunan's strength.

French finance minister says tax cuts will be more than 10 billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow suit
PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive its flagging economy.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Mr. Le Maire said the ECB's latest monetary easing move created an opportunity for resilient governments to invest more.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to record lows on September 12th and plans to restart debt purchases to drive down borrowing costs in the hope of stimulating the recovery and pushing up inflation.
"Low interest rates will not allow Europe to return to prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, " Mr Le Maire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, and it needs it now, as soon as possible." Don't wait for the situation to get worse before you act," he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on many occasions.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, giving a big boost to its economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, with export-dependent Germany bearing the brunt.
Mr Le Maire said the tax burden on French households would be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including a 5 billion euro tax cut.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros as the corporate tax rate is gradually reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period.

Study: U.S. National Healthy Eating Index Grows Slightly but Still Challenging - XINHUA
BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government's healthy eating index has grown moderately over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58, according to a new U.S. study.
But with a full score of 100, it's not worth celebrating.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
One of the study's authors, Dr. Fangfang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said Americans still eat too much food that could cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, the most common diseasein u.S. citizens.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 24.
The study is based on the findings of a U.S. government health survey of 44,000 adults conducted between 1999 and 2016.
"Despite significant improvements, significant dietary challenges remain, " the authors write.
These challenges are known to include getting U.S. citizens to cut back on snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter and other foods containing saturated fat.
The study found that people's daily dietary intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, exceeding the recommended 10 percent intake limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was a reduction in sugar intake from 16 percent to about 14 percent , but the intake was still too high .
Officials believe that the intake of added sugar scann saued at less than 10 % in the daily diet .
Researchers believe it is related to a reduction in people's consumption of sweet soda, but Zhang stressed that sugars are often added to even less-than-sweet foods such as yogurt and ketchup.
U.S. adults have a small increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain categories.
However, data for 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5 % of the daily diet.
Despite a slight reduction in salt intake and a reduction in drinking fruit juice leading to a low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang said they still account for up to 42 percent of daily calories, many of them from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on a biennial personal health survey that asked adults to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asking this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's dietary guidelines for U.S. residents recommend a "healthy eating pattern" to reduce their risk of chronic disease.
The guidelines say people should consume more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and protein-provided seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seeds.
The number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled during the study period, more than 7 percent, and obesity rates increased over many years of the study -- about 70 percent of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.

China's railway tunnel shaft record is set for the deepest
China News Agency Baoshan September 27 (Zhang Weiming Xu for The State Zhou Jingbo) after more than 1200 days of day and night construction, in the construction of the University (Li) Rui (Li) Railway Gao Ligongshan Tunnel No. 1 shaft completed on the 27th, the depth of the well reached 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the record for the deepest of china's railway tunnel shafts, and this is in a large number of water in the case of the creation.
The 34.5-kilometer-long Grand Rui Railway Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, located in Yunnan, runs from the coast of the South Bank to the Gaoligong Mountain Range, and is the longest tunnel in Asia on the double-line single-hole.
The tunnel runs through 19 fault zones, with a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, and because it covers almost all the adverse geology and significant risks that tunnel construction may encounter, the Mount Gaoligon Tunnel is known as the "Geological Museum" for tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important auxiliary pit road of the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, which is responsible for the important task of increasing the working surface to achieve "long tunnel short play" and the later railway operation ventilation.
The successful excavation of the No. 1 shaft to the bottom of the well marks the official entry of the Gao Ligong Mountain Tunnel into the horizontal tunnel construction, to the bottom of the well after excavation and equipment replacement, the underground can be added 4 operating surfaces, speed up the tunnel tunnel excavation speed.
"The shaft is all in the granite formation, because the granite formation cracks more, can not stop the water, from top to bottom flow non-stop, basically how much deep water pressure of the well is how much. "
China Railway Tunnel Bureau, The Chief Engineer of the Project Department of The Great Rui Railway, Shi Jingxuan, told reporters that the construction of the shaft, many times occurred sudden mud surge water, collapse and other dangerous situations, the construction side invited experts to the scene to pulse, more than 20 discussions and treatment programs.
"When the maximum water surge in the shaft, it reached more than 300 cubic meters per hour, more than 700 meters deep at the bottom of the well, the water pressure is equivalent to 700 meters deep under the sea floor. "
"If we don't pump and drain in time , we will flood the well for 10 meters in one hour , and we spend almost 85% of our time treating the water and 15% of the time digging in , " Mr. Shi said . "
In order to overcome the geological problems such as vertical conservation development, sudden mud surge water and water-rich granite, the tunnel construction adopts the systematic water control measures combining "exploration, injection and excavation" to reduce the construction risk.
After many improvements, the construction of the No. 1 shaft formed a drilling system, hair-out system, suspension system, winch lifting system and other mechanized assembly lines, to achieve eye-opening, blasting, blasting, template installation, concrete pouring and other mechanized operations, speed up the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the shaft successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 762.59 meters.
The 330-kilometer-long Dawei Railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Passage and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the Belt and Road.

The United Nations Environment Programme announced the winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, a week ago, but the day's attendees were still in a state of excitement.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency , the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme , Ine-Annoson , said that the Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that has brought hundreds of millions of people to action to understand the environmental challenges facing mankind and what humans can do for the environment .
It uses technology to connect people and the environment so that every individual can participate in the action to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" by the China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Financial Services) in August 2016 launched on the Alipay platform, users through the "Ant Forest" to record their daily life of green travel, online payment of utilities and other low-carbon actions to accumulate "green energy", in the mobile phone "tree".

Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economy "report card."
The second quarter of the U.S. economic "report card" showed that U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed significantly from the previous quarter, driven by a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty it brought with them were the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
Final revision data released by the U.S. Commerce Department on the 26th showed that U.S. GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2 % in the second quarter , unchanged from the previously released revision , but significantly lower than the 3.1 % in the first quarter .
Data show that consumption growth was the main factor supporting U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending , which accounts for about 70% of the U.S. economy , grew by 4.6 % quarter-on-quarter , boosting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points .
In addition, government spending and investment led to economic growth of 0.82 percentage points.
However , private sector investment fell by 6.3 % in the second quarter from the previous quarter , dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percentage points in the current quarter , while exports fell by 5.7 % from the previous quarter , and net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percentage points in the current quarter .
Private sector investment has not only failed to maintain last year's growth, but has fallen sharply as rising economic frictions and uncertainty have hit business confidence, says Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ainside Macroeconomics.
Knap believes U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain in decline next year, influenced by policy uncertainty.
Analysts believe that while consumer growth has provided strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty it creates have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the Outlook for U.S. Consumption.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, the highest in a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the University of Michigan and the study's lead author.
Analysts generally expect the U.S. economy to continue to slow in the future.
But some experts say the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions ease.
Keryn Birch, a global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, expects the US economy to continue its downward trend this year and slow to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody's Analytics , predicts that the U.S. economy will grow by 2.3 % this year and slow further to 1.6 % next year , assuming economic and trade frictions do not continue to escalate .
Ellen Harzen, investment manager at Putnam Investments, points out that the biggest concern for companies right now is the economic and trade disputes and the uncertainties they bring, and if they are resolved, the uncertainty will be significantly reduced and the industrial sector will perform much better than it does now.
Matt Meli, equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said economic and trade frictions remain "top issues" and the main reason for the sharp fluctuations in U.S. capital markets this year.

"Transferring part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, is the development of state-owned enterprises to share the results of the whole people and the basic old-age insurance system is the full embodiment of intergenerational equity, is a policy measure based on the current, taking into account the long-term." "
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Plan for the Transfer of Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund, which requires the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out the pilot program.
According to Liu Kun, the pre-transfer work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred in three batches, with a total transfer of state-owned capital amounting to about 860.1 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions of the Ministry of Finance to perform the duties of funders has been basically completed.
The transfer of the central enterprise has a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-transfer work of enterprises has been carried out one after another.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state-owned capital transferred, respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out the preliminary preparations for the transfer, for the next step of the implementation of the transfer laid the foundation.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the central and local transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund work in 2019 to fully open, and by the end of 2020 to basically complete.
The meeting held on the same day made a concrete deployment for the comprehensive push-off.
The meeting stressed the need to carry out the transfer work pragmatically and efficiently.
"According to the schedule, the transfer process will be largely completed by the end of 2020.
Transfer working hours are tight and tasks are heavy. "
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and make careful arrangements to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required, make solid progress, accurately grasp the transfer policy content, strengthen communication and coordination, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner.
The transfer of state-owned funds to enrich the social security fund - from the "enrich the social security fund money bag" starting point, the destination is to provide a strong support for the old-age security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but opened the "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the SASAC, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the Notice on the Comprehensive Pushing and Transfer of Part of the State-owned Capital to Enrich the Work of the Social Security Fund, which clearly defined the timetable for the transfer of state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, that is, the central and local transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund work in 2019.
After the release of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments were quickly implemented.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10% of its stake in ICBC and Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, with the total value of the two equity transfers exceeding 115 billion yuan.
According to the provisions, the Social Security Foundation and other undertaking subjects as financial investors, enjoy the state-owned shares assigned to the right to income, disposal and the right to know.
ICBC and AgBank said in the announcement that the change in equity will not cause changes in the bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, the author believes that similar transfer of state-owned enterprises equity transfer is not a simple change of equity ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects of "addition operations."
The first step of some state-owned transfer of social security , the "addition results " , is naturally able to reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people , and the development results are shared by the whole population .
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises in China's economy are mostly in important industries and areas, the overall profitability is strong and more stable.
Among them, leading enterprises are continuously achieving better and bigger and stronger.
On July 10, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to fully push forward the transfer of some state-owned capital this year to enrich the work of the social security fund.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it will work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Executive Meeting of the State Council, to do a good job in the comprehensive push to transfer part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflect the basic old-age insurance system intergenerational equity and the development of state-owned enterprises to share the results of the whole people.
The second step of the transfer, "Addition Results", is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security funds and further strengthen the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and this time as the transfer of the main body of state capital, most of them have the ability to continue to make profits and dividends, not only can effectively supplement the social security fund, but also for the social security fund to provide the source of living water.
Estimates show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the proportion of deposits on basic old-age insurance can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, "Addition Results", is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
The transfer to undertake the main body to obtain revenue is the way is "dividend-based, operation as a supplement".
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the Social Security Fund does obtain the main income from equity dividends.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the social security fund has a strong ability to operate capital.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will help to improve the level of enterprise management and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the social security fund as an investment wind vane, the increase of shareholding weight, is conducive to further enhance its influence in the market, and in the market to play a "stabilizer" role.
In addition, it is also beneficial to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, and guide investors to invest rationally and value.

BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's use of advanced centrifuges to make enriched uranium has once again violated the Iran nuclear agreement, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Tuesday.

Under the nuclear deal, Iran could only set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and allowed Iran to use only a small number of more advanced models for research, but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the use of a nuclear bomb.
Reported that the INTERNATIONAL Atomic Energy Agency report said: "On September 25, the Agency has confirmed that Iran has developed advanced centrifuges for models 2 and 3 ... Is accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium. "
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency on the 26th to Member States presented the report , a diplomatic official responded : " They are busy at the ( Natanz enriched uranium ) facility . " "

China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
White Paper: China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
The white paper points out that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world.
With China's overall national strength and international influence rapidly rising, the white paper says, some in the international community are worried that China will follow the path of "national power and hegemony", and some have proposed the so-called "China threat theory".
This is both cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances brought about by the power of long-term, and deliberate distortions in order to safeguard one's own vested interests.
Realizing national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of all peoples.
"China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge to the world. "
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the biggest contributor to world economic growth, China's scientific and technological innovation in the world economic growth to inject new momentum, the future of China's economic stabilization and power source role is more prominent.
At present, the world's economic growth is not enough, the sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is moving from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization are accelerating, the economic structure is deeply adjusted, industrial optimization continues to upgrade, and new economic growth points are emerging.
According to the McKinsey Global Research Report, the integration of China and the rest of the world economies is expected to generate economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion by 2040, equivalent to 15 to 26 percent of the global economy. "
The white paper stresses that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term positive for world economic development.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to "de-link" China from the world economy by treating China's economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge" and trying to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain.
The white paper points out that opening up to the outside world in all directions creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend".
China unswervingly pursues a win-win strategy of opening up, achieves greater efforts and higher levels of opening-up, has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, and larger-scale "going out" benefits more countries.
"Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-way, one-way benefit."
Mutual benefit can last in the long run. "
China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection, and other countries should expand opening up and take appropriate measures to improve their business environment, the white paper said.
Only by moving in the same way can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, and work together to make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, and form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The white paper points out that China provides more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality co-construction of the Belt and Road, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign aid.
"China's development has benefited from the international community, and it has never forgotten to give back to the international community to provide more and better public goods for the international community." "

Demonstrations blast president to step down in Egypt's mountain rain to authorities show strong crackdown
Twitter hashtags and social media are trumpeting Egyptians taking to the streets today to peacefully demand the ouster of President Sisi.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress them.
Since the then-military chief, Mr. Sisi, seized power in a military coup in 2013, dissent has all but disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest has been plunged into extreme danger.
The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based NGO, says more than 1,900 people have been arrested since protests over the weekend that called for Mr. Sisi's ouster, the Guardian reported.
Allegations of corruption surrounding Thesis and his family's profligacy in pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to take to the streets on the 20th.
Egypt's Interior Ministry yesterday firmly stated that any attempt to destabilize the country will be decisive, and will not be soft.
Central Cairo has long been heavily guarded, with riot police, security vehicles and plainclothes police strewn across the streets around Tahrir Square, the site of Egypt's 2011 revolution.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of key scholars and social sages on the 25th, including Cairo University political science professor and well-known columnist Nafa.
He tweeted on the 24th : " I have no doubt that continuing to let Sessy rule be disastrous . " "
"It is in Egypt's interest for him to step down immediately. "
Before Nafa's arrest, Hosni, who had served as a spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, Anan, was detained.
Anan was arrested last year after trying to run for president with Sisi.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davutoglu, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians say sweeping dissent reflects the government's instability and fragility at a time when the economic woes of the poor and the middle class are growing.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour , a former presidential candidate , said : The crackdown highlights the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and how scared it is . "
"Because the economy has been messed up by him, and because of widespread political repression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who may replace them." "
Noor pointed out that the government's heavy-handed approach will only increase people's anger in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation.
Now that the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor who is now in exile in Spain and is a construction contractor for Egypt's military, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month, boasting that he had benefited from government corruption and setting off a wave of small-scale demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company, Amlak General Contract, could get lucrative contracts without having to go through a legal bidding process, stressing the corruption of the military and Sessy's relatives, including first lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply remorseful for his involvement.
Ali claims that he helped Sisigai's magnificent palaces and luxury hotels contrast with the current abject life of Egyptians, who have yet to pay for it.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Stand up and you're not alone," "Sissy you're done," "Sessy roll" and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets calling on people to take to the streets peacefully to demand That's going down.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarwick has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Sissy is doomed... He's done, and his supporters are going to make a big mistake now. "

New rules for comments: social capital to obtain rural land management rights need to be qualified
Social capital needs to be qualified to obtain the right of rural land management
"Measures for the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights" for public consultation To supervise the transfer of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published on the "Rural Land Management Rights Transfer Management Measures (Revised Draft For Comments) " (hereinafter referred to as the "Opinion Draft") for public consultation notice, increasing the social capital transfer of industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights supervision and risk prevention.
The Opinion Draft is open to the public for comments from now on.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contracting Law, further consolidate and improve the basic management system in rural areas, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the "three-power separation" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Measures for the Transfer and Management of Rural Land Contractmanagement, and formed the Opinion Draft.
Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned that the first published "Opinion Draft" has a number of important changes.
The newly revised Rural Land Contract Law defines the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "three-power separation", sets up "land contract management right" and "land management right" respectively, and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange and transfer of land management rights (lease, subcontracting, equity or other means) of land contract management rights.
In this "Opinion Draft", in order to implement the concept of "three-power separation", effectively respond to the "rural land contracting law" revision of the key purpose, and take into account the transfer of land management rights and land contract management rights exchange, transfer in the parties, procedures, supervision and other aspects of the large differences, the revised draft for the transfer of the scope of circulation, focusing on the transfer of land management rights, transfer methods including leasing, equity, etc. , the name of the regulations from the "rural land transfer management measures" changed to the "rural land transfer management measures."
The transfer and exchange of land contract management rights will be separately promulgated as administrative measures.
The Opinion Draft points out that under the background of the "separation of powers", farmers only take stock in the right to operate land for a certain period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, farmers only risk losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, so it is not legally necessary to provide for the return of the contracted land to the original contractor, and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In view of the problem of preventing the risk of farmers losing their land, preferential shares, rent-after shares and buy-back have been produced in practice.
Considering that the preferred shares have a more mature theoretical discussion in the company law, it is suggested that it should be regarded as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of loss of land.
